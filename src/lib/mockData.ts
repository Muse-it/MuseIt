    36: "Well, I thought I’d vent a little since this is anonymous and basically no one will see this. I’m a sixteen year old girl, I’ve been introverted my whole life so I just never leave my house. I threw myself at difficult obsessions, art, hobbies, games, visual novels, YouTube rabbit holes. I have no social skills, no life skills. Due to me growing up with art/anime from a super young age, I ended up never fitting in, Japanese music has always been weird to people around me, the monotone YouTubers I watch are boring to others, I could not get into Bollywood, I didn’t know what they were talking about so I tried searching and studying but I only ever liked one or two popular movies which is fine for maybe one conversation but I can’t keep using the same topic again and again. It’s exhausting. Around two years ago, I was diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist, his exact words were that I had no light in my eyes. After thinking about it more, I realized I’ve always been this way, a recluse, a hermit without friends. I make online friends often but we usually drift apart. I changed schools five times at this point because we moved a lot, I never made lasting friendships at schools. Now I just stopped trying, I don’t try to make friends anymore, it’s exhausting knowing eventually I’ll lose them too. \nMost of the time, this loneliness isn’t so bad, I can take it but sometimes it just gets so overwhelming. I see all these people around me getting into relationships, telling me about them. I don’t want to hear it, I just end up with a reminder of how unlovable I feel because I’m cold and distant.\n\nI don’t think it’s due to my appearance, sure, I don’t make much effort other than washing my face with face wash but I look average. My skin texture is a little bad at my forehead but my fringe covers it anyways. \n\nIt’s no one’s fault really, I’m just a recluse so people just don’t know me or don’t remember me. I don’t know if I’m even coherent anymore but I guess i just wanted this off my chest. I feel awful.",

    39: "This is my last post on this acc, possibly my suicide note.  \n  \nI've been depressed my whole life. I was abused by my family and bullied as a child l. I started hurting myself when I turned 7, there was no other way to cope. I tried everything. Books, meditation, psychotherapy, sports, video games, music, art, EVERYTHING. Nothing could help.  \n  \nThat's when I gave up. I was only 10 already and lost all hope. Nothing could distract me and nothing made me happy.  I made my first attempt at 12. Had to go to the psych ward after I failed. Didn't help, of course.  \n  \nI ran away from my parents at 13 and moved to a group home. Things only got worse. I got diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD, Asperger's and social anxiety. I'm going to multiple therapists, but none of them can really help. And to be honest, I don't even want help anymore. It's like I'm addicted to the pain. I can't be bothered to care about myself anymore.  \n  \nAll I want is to get drunk and high. Seriously, there's nothing else that even comes close to making me feel as good as drugs.  \n  \nFuck, I don't have the motivation to write anything else. I've poured my heart out on this damn site so many fucking times. Do any of you even care?\n  \n  \nI just wanna die man. I just wanna fucking die.  \nI'm so tired.\n  \n\n",

    41: "firstly because its REALLY INTERESTING!! but also because by wrongly defining goth it can erase the culture entirely.\n\ngoth is subculture. it originates from Gothic literature like Dracula, Edgar Allen Poe, and Frankenstein, and surrounds themes of death. its also defined by the post-punk music genre, which exploded in 1980s Britain after the punk era.\n\ngoth bands include The Cure, Bauhaus, Joy Division, Souxsie and the Banshees, and more! there's also other genres associated with goth that you can look up.\n\nfashion can be a large part of goth!! but its not all of it, and there's different styles - Romantic Goth, Ravegoth, Technogoth...\n\nJust because a girl is wearing a eyeliner and black boots doesn't mean she's goth - but she might be! who knows.\n\nhere's some more common misconceptions\n\n* deftones is not actually a goth band. they're great, but do not fall under goth genres\n* emo is not the same thing as goth. they have similarities, but they're from different eras\n* you don't have to be sad to be goth. its a moody culture, but you don't have to be depressed.\n\nthere are no hard rules to goth, but generally its considered that you should at least listen to goth music to be considered one. idk tho. im not your dad, do what you want.\n\nmight've gotten some of this wrong idk, do ur own research if ur interested",

    44: "So I’ve moved into a new house with my mother and the walls are so damn thin she can hear practically everything I do or say if I don’t have headphones on or I’m whispering. I want my privacy, I want to say whatever I want without having to be scolded. \n\nAs many people do, I make occasionally offensive jokes from time to time with my friends. Nothing too serious, always poking fun at my friends and they do the same with me. I’ll make jokes about where they’re from, stuff I can remember about them, etcetera etcetera.\n\nThe problem is tho is that my mom is always listening. I could be sat in my room and making jokes with my friends but if I say the wrong thing a little too loud then I get scolded and threatened with taking my PlayStation away or my phone. The thing is tho I’ve got speculated autism (my friend with autism said I’ve most likely got it but I’ve never been confirmed so take it with a grain of salt). If I’m without my phone or PlayStation I’m without my music, I can’t survive without music. Music is something that’s so important to me that the main reason I always have my phone is to listen to music. Off topic but needed to show how important my stuff is to me.\n\nShe’s always listening in on what I’m saying, on what I’m doing, but she never just leaves me alone. I’d say I’m pretty self aware that since I’m a teenager I’m probably blowing this out of proportion but I don’t feel like I can talk at all how I want to with my friends when she’s around.\n\nLike today, I make a joke with some of my friends about how one of my Mexican friends probably hopped the border or built a house to come here. It’s all obviously fun and games between me and him but my mom comes stomping over and swings my door open. I always mute my mic before I talk to her so I just kinda looked at her, waiting for her to say something. She didn’t quite yell but said loudly that she’s tired of me making jokes like that and that she’s “about done with that game and that she’ll take it away if I say something like that again”.  \n\nI’ve always felt as if a kid’s room is somewhere I shouldn’t ever act like how they want to express themselves is bad bc it’s a safe haven to be themself. I could get it if I was saying the N word or something but I’m just poking fun at my friend. I laughed after saying it so it obviously was a joke. This type of stuff has happened before too so now I just feel like I shouldn’t even hop on my PlayStation just so I don’t get in trouble. I don’t wanna talk to her about stuff either bc it feels like she’s always listening anyway so I might as well just let her hear it to figure it out.\n\nAlso (I’m gonna start ranting about other things here, if u want to read u can but the top thing was the main problem), when I tried to say I didn’t like my bed frame bc it was too tall and I asked if I could just have my mattress on the floor, she said no. I’ve always felt like my room is my room, if I want to change it I should be able to. I hate this stupid bed frame anyway, it’s so big for no reason and I’ve always seen almost every bed frame as useless anyway. \n\nI love my mother bc ik how much she’s sacrificed for me and how much more she will but I just want to be left alone and decorate my room how I want. I’ve always felt like my feelings for how I want to do something have been ignored but that’s just parents in general ig. Also, my little comment on how important music was to me earlier will come in handy right now. I’m a sensitive person on some stuff, I’ll admit it. Music is one of them. If I get my phone taken or my PlayStation and I don’t have music, I’ll probably get kinda depressed.\n\nAlso, if she takes my phone or PlayStation, I can’t talk to my friends from my hometown or that are in different places where I can’t see them daily. I don’t wanna lose contact with them and feel like they feel like I’m ignoring them. She constantly threats every time I’m in trouble to take my phone or PlayStation. It makes me just not want to talk to her a lot of times and be alone. I hardly ever want to ask for stuff except food and simple requests bc Idk how she’ll react to me asking. \n\nThat’s it, yap done",
    45: "Like i never thought in 1,000 years that K would be a swiftie and have a Stanley life every single other girl but I do. Here is my defense:\n\nTaylor swifts music is HAPPY and makes me want to SING and DANCE. I used to listen to rap and sad music and it made me depressed asf and really affected my outlook on life. So therefore I am a swiftie.\n\nStanley cups are just all around useful. You can use the straw, turn the little thingy to use a sipping hole, or completely close off all the holes. It hold about 2 water bottles and fits in a cup holder.\n\nI realised that most teenage girls that are swifties and have Stanleys provably think the same was we do, but we just live in such a judgemental society that things like that are “basic” and are shunned upon. \n\nTL;DR—- We need to stop judging teenage girls for being “basic” when you would most likely do/have the same things if you were a female.

    47: 'Ok i know this post is long and also if you dont really care then please stop reading im not trying to get people like you to help. (If you want to know im 15 male) Also this is kind of split into sectioms where for a while i talk about parts of my life and i know i will sound winey but idc, if this helps me im doing it.\n\nSo i basically dont know what to do anymore, i feel like my life kinda sucks and ive made a few posts and then got a few helpful comments that did help me out. Now this did lead to me not needing to make any more posts here for about a month or so. However, my problems have well.. came back and gotten worse. Tho i do have 2 people that i would call friend now but as always they are not perfect and still not really "best" friend type people. Also one of my previous friends have just slipped into a sort of idk like guy ig since hes been influenced by the other people my friends hang around(which sucks because i thought he might be a best friend within the future). Then when my 2 friends are around the others they become slightly like them and then everyone starts basically bullying each other over small things like miss pronouncing a word or saying something that is classed as \'stupid\' when it a hypothetical situation or just a thought. Thats mainly what i hate about them and how they are just so toxic and goes off as banter when its really not, its straight up bullying. I have tried to find new friends online in games such as vrchat but no luck at all since i spent 2 hours and i didnt talk to anyone since i was too scared (yes, also comes up later). Overall i get really nervous with new people and just cant start a conversation with anyone for the life of me but yeah thats pretty much it about my friends. Soooo still no luck with girlfriends but i did try with one person which i tried to talk to them and then they looked interested but then after i got like 2 sentences in they probably realised i was just some loser who got nervous around women.. so yeah.. which i was very much and felt my self stuttering almost every word. Then i had one of those times (i think everone does this.. right?) where you listen to music thats usually sad or slowed and had the thought of if i cant even talk to women then how tf am i getting a girlfriend let alone keeping one.. its just huh? Same with friends how i cant talk to anyone new sooo whats the point anymore.. (title, idk just pointed it out) i feel like i can never really get a girlfriend or a new friend ever. Like ever. One thing thanks to those people who said how to talk to women tho it didnt really work because i tried to seem confident, but you just read how that worked out. Now for my mental state.. its not good like at all. And i have almost cried like 10 times just reflecting on everything. Posting on reddit just feels like some sort of therapy for me ig.. because sometimes it actually helps so thank you. Overall tho i feel mainly depressed like actually tho you get sometimes where im not thinking about negative thoughts and genuinely feel happy. I have researched on how to maybe help with this and luckily i havnt had any suicidal thoughts or anything.. yet. But i have been working out like 2 hours a week and its not really helping i do feel proud of myself but i just want to feel attention or affection at the end of the day. Not having working out as my top priority rn. Also yes i briefly mentioned how i want to be a victim in i think my first post idk to sum this up i feel like they might be understanding and not feel awkward about my nervousness and therefore i would be able to talk to them and they might pity me.. but also this isnt good ik because obvious reasons.. and dont even get me started on addictions. but yeah thats pretty much all. \n\nSo to some a bit up i just need advice to help me.. like how do i overcome nervousness? And my friends suck and i aint getting a girlfriend i dont think ever (not because i dont want to but because i cant) also i mentally not ok and need help with fixing it ty for reading this (if you did) already a weight is off my chest just typing this i think thats all will be looking at like every comment because it will help. Even if you just say "you got this" still will make me smile :)\n\nOne morree thing i need to know if everyone else has felt like this before at somepoint just so you can tell me how you fixed these problems or atleast some of them.',

    52: "Basically what the title says...\n\nI've been experiencing alot of depression at night and it effects the way my day goes in the morning for school. I'm 17 btw. My usual schedule is to wake up at like 6am for school get ready and then get home, I sometimes have work (I only work 15-20h a week) and I go to that until 6 or 8 and then I watch a stream or play video games for a few hours. At about 10pm or later I start to get depressed for no reason, like I swear it's a switch. Some days it doesn't happen others it does, I somtimes have streaks of it. \n\nI don't have a bad living situation really, my family isn't bad or abusive other than man dad started doing some vices which kinda hurt me because he is a big role model in my life. (My mom is out of the picture).\n\nI have anxiety at school and have a few friends that just Bully me idk if they are even friends or bullies, the line is so blurred because I haven't had actual friends since I moved from my town.\n\nIk lots of people say to try to distract yourself from the depression with like music or streams or video games or an activities but it just doesn't work for me, it honestly makes it worse. I've resorted to just going to bed instead of feeling terrible. But somtimes when I'm depressed at night I can't fall asleep and my thoughts just race in my head about how useless I really am to the people around me and that if i wasn't here on earth it wouldn't chnage or be easier for others. \n\nIk this isn't a good state of mind and I'm aware but I just honestly give up. Last week I was fine and then this week depression has hit me like a truck. I just don't understand....\n\nI've started to think maybe I could try self harm as a option to maybe prevent myself from feeling like this. Was going to buy a exacto knife and cut myself every time I felt this way and maybe it would help. \n\nIdk tbh, any ideas are welcome I'm kinda just done, just haven't decided how yet.",

    54: "TW: abuse/drugs/sh/violence/other stuff\n\nOkay, so, I have NO idea what to do about this... I am not sure where else to go, or who else to tell. I have tried texting hotlines multiple times for advice but they either ended the text or my messages didn't go through. I am SO sick of this and I feel VERY stupid because I have zero knowledge on legal things and I am slow as heck when catching up to anything.\n\nThis is important for context. I don't remember anything at all except big events that happened before this summer break. I guess my brain blocked out all the trauma or I didn't realize it was happening (maybe both). I grew up with my biological mom and two half siblings. My mom did a lot of drugs and went through physical abuse in relationships and whatnot. Eventually she got arrested and I was in fostercare with someone who knew her through my sister because my brothers would pass through foster care too sometimes (I don't know how this works). Anyway, we got seperated and I got adopted by her (foster mom) blah blah blah.\n\nFast forward, I am here alone in this house with her. She divorced foster dad for abuse, and her sons live elsewhere. My non-biological mom (from now on referred to as \"mom\") is literally the worst person I know.\n\nI am not sure if this is my fault. Maybe I'm just too lazy, uncaring, and apathetic... But she is always mad over every teeny tiny little thing. One time I accidentally locked the doorknob to the back door, and she was SO mad. She's never told me I can't lock it before. Maybe my memory is crap. Either way, it's just a door. A lock. To protect our house... I know she takes a lot of meds. Sometimes she is in an angry state and brings back irrelevant issues from years or weeks ago out of the blue, then grills me on it for HOURS. In the past she has kept me from sleeping like, \"Oh, you can go to bed now little princess\" (sarcastic tone) but then comes back less than five minutes later saying more crap to me.\n\nWhen she's mad I usually go outside, sit behind the car, and draw or read. She wouldn't let me do it at first. Now she threatens to call the cops but I go outside anyway because I need some frickin SPACE. I am literally still on our own property. I used to only be allowed to go in the backyard, never the front, while she was mad. She said it's because she said so. Then she wouldn't let me walk the dog because she thinks I am going to hurt her (Dog is an Akita, very large and strong, for context). That's insane. I LOVE animals. She put the two cats in her room one night and shut the door because she thought I would let them out to prove a point... I know damn well she doesn't care THAT much because one time she threw a spoon with melted chocolate or Nutella and called the dog over, asking if I want to kill the dog. Thankfully, the dog didn't eat any of it. Speaking of throwing stuff, there are MULTIPLE holes and dents in the walls. She also took a basket of my drawing supplies to Goodwill because I didn't clean my room the SECOND she told me to, and there was a Deadpool comic book we bought in there, and probably other stuff not art related. Now it's gone. I LOVED that comic book. And no I can't just get another one. I am not able to spend my money. Actually, hell, I am pretty sure she moved my wallet thing and now I can't find it and she DOESN'T know where it IS. I am BROKE. I want a job but she says she is not driving me. That I have to drive myself. I am 16, just started learning how to drive. I don't even want to drive places; I hate driving. I want to walk. I want to explore nature.\n\nUnrelated to whatever I was just yapping about, I can't use any electronics without asking. I am allowed one hour online, thirty minutes doing something like a chore or whatever, then another hour online. That's fine, but if she is mad she takes and hides my electronics in her room then forgets where she hid them. Then, when I start looking after she says I can play the next day, she gets offended saying there's no reason to find them. The VR is expensive. I am NOT letting her lose it because I paid for HALF of it. She also broke my old phone, my Android I basically worshipped for the APK file ability and easy peasy navigation. She threw it at the wall, causing me to utter the first curse word ever heard by a human from my mouth. It broke, the back falling off, the screen wrecked. She broke it because I was calling my brother for HELP while she was mad.\n\nMy mom constantly calls me sarcastic names like \"princess\", \"sweet pea\", and things like that, y'known, the whole southern kabang. Sometimes she non-sarcastically calls me things too, like a jerk, or compares me to my biological mom. She calls me disrespectful, once she called me \"monster\" and \"evil\". She makes sarcastic remarks like, \"let me do such-and-such for you my poor baby, if you're going to act like a two-year-old I will treat you like one,\" and \"let me do everrryyyything for you, because poor little \\[deadname\\] can't do anything herself.\"\n\nShe is always mocking and inaccuratly imitating me. If I cry, she asks, \"why are you crying? hmph, I should be the one crying! Stop trying to make me feel sorry for you with this fake rountine you have down to an artform\" and she will exaggerate fake crying, imitating me. \n\nOf course I have told her it makes me uncomfortable. But her excuse is like, \"you call me names too\" (i don't) or \"what names have i called you\" which is humiliating to repeat them, since they already bring me pain hearing them as a trans boy. \n\nSpeaking of transgenderness, I asked her if I could use her computer for research, because I was writing an informational essay I wanted to present to her, for fun. She asked what it was about and I said it was about myself. She got confused about why I was researching things and got mad when I said I would tell her when she reads it. She asked when I would read it, I said Wednesday, because that's when my friend comes to my house after school. I was planning on reading it to them, and have my friend around so I would feel safe and have support. Well, that set her OFF. She said she has a degree in psychology and knows all about LGBTQ and doesn't need a LECTURE from some kids. She demanded me to read it the next day. We sat in the kitchen and I had five pages handwritten. I was forced to read it all, without support from my friend, and immediately felt unsafe. I explained (don't laugh) the real meaning of a furry to her, because she had misinformed views. I had statics I pulled from multiple sites, I had quotes, evidence, the whole shebang. My English teacher would've been proud. Additionally, I wrote about my LGBTQ identity, that I feel like a boy and I want to be called he/him, but at that point my mom entered mad mode and everything I said was going in one ear, out the other. She said I am concerning, confused, and getting a therapist. She took my papers and did who-knows-what with them. They are probably in her room right now. Luckily I skipped reading the page about alterhumanity, and totally ripped up the pages on atheistic Satanism beforehand (if you don't know what that is, there's an AMA on my account with an explanation). She said I am more NON-BINARY than anything. This is after multiple times in the past she has literally said, \"well I think YOU think you know you are a girl.\" Okay first of all, \"I think you think\" is dumb ASF. She has NO CLUE how or what I think about. She even said, \"well you never mentioned it before, so your friend must have influenced you. She is degrading you, trying to clone all of you into a little army. She wants you all to look and act like she wants. Ever noticed all her friends have short hair? Now she is gaslighting you into it too. You've literally never mentioned any of this before. \" What the actual fck. OF COURSE I have never mentioned it. I was trans in denial for so long because I was misinformed by HER and didn't know it was possible to be comfortable in my own skin. Now she's saying things like, \"if you cut your hair you will hate it\" and \"boys can have pretty long hair too\" and she NEVER uses my pronouns. I texted my friend this and they were so upset. They never comes to my house because they HATE my mom. I texted my biological mom about it, and she said she loves me no matter what, and offered to text my half siblinga about it so I didn't have to. They don't understand. My brothers laughed about it and said it was sad and made a joke about not being surprised if someone they knew suddenly came out as gay. My sister just asked if she got permission to tell them. Later she texted me saying she supports me. Every now and them my bio mom asks how the identity stuff is going, and I even told her about alterhumanity. She doesn't know how to use my pronouns, (\"guys your little sister is now your little brother, she- I mean he said that she- I mean he, look I am going to call her she with you guys and he around her\" my mom wasn't trying to be rude, but that defeats the purpose of pronouns... it was funny!) \n\nAnyway, I am basically not allowed to cut my hair. Mom calls me girl and stuff. She insults me and uses my deadname. I am actually glad she doesn't use my name or pronouns, that would be giving her ammunition. The waiting time for a therapist, which I did want, was a couple months. It has been more than a couple and I still haven't got one.\n\nLet me state first, SOMEHOW I am NOT depressed and I looooove life! Genuinely, I love being alive so much, I am almost always happy (that is, when my mom is not a jerk). After seven months of cutting, she found out. I never really made an attempt to hide it, hell, I would cut while in class. Anyway, she took my X-acto knife. I had extra blades in the bathroom but decided to just give those to her too. She actually cared and stuff, so while she was crying over my messed up arm, I was smiling and trying not to laugh because I was happy she cared. It didn't take long for that to become ammunition too. She mocked my self-harm when she was mad. \"Now you're just like all the other kids. You are like those kids you hate\" (in which the song, \"Becoming What I Hate\" by Archetypes Collide came into my head) \"Now you are emo.\" like WOW. Okay. She said I was doing it for attention. So, like the dumbass I am I started searching up pictures of sh and I read something about another unexpected tool to use... yeah uhm... light bulb. A couple months later she found those too and didn't cry this time. Now I have no blades (you may cheer, I guess) but now I have nothing to take my stress out on. I bang my head against the wall or use my nails.\n\nAnywho, as you can see I am under a lot of pressure. I feel like I am stupid. Her sons went to Georgia Tech and make loads of money because they are sooo smart. But me? I can't remember what I ate yesterday. I don't know what I was doing an hour ago. If something is not told in story form, I will never remember. My mom expects me to get perfect grades too. She says she will settle for B's but that I should get A's and that I am \"playing dumb\" to get out of putting in effort.\n\nI feel like I am the best, nicest person ever. I am proud of how I help people, strive educate them, and spread positivity. Proud of myself. I feel like a good person. But then my mom comes and stomps all over my bright and peachy day. She calls me names, asks why I can't do anything right. Expects me to do everything for her. \"You never offer to cook meals. When IIII was little, I made meals for my family\" and just keeps comparing me to her, or me to her sons, or me to my bio mom. \"If you run away, who are you going to go to? Mama (bio) will just use you, she can't even take care of herself.\" and I used to not care. I used to hate my bio mom. But we have met up a couple times (with mom too) and Mama is doing SO much better. She quit big drugs, but vapes sometimes. She has a job and a car now. She has offered to pay for things at meetups like Fair entry tickets, food, movie tickets. She is repairing her life. She is trying to be my Mama again... I just want a mom, man...\n\ni was so fucking happy this morning. i was on Reddit spreading it to everyone, complimenting, giving friendly advice, spreading positive messages and encouragement. then my mom caught me on VR which is like, yeah ok i wasnt supposed to be on.\n\n but then she got mad because she said i was making too much noise when she said she was going to sleep in and then got mad bc i didnt offer to make her breakfast after she had a long day yesterday. firstly, i have to eat too. im not waiting hours to use the goddamn air-fryer and there wasnt any other food. second, I WAS LITERALLY MAKING HER BREAKFAST. and she didnt even want breakfast because i asked if she wanted any of what i made and she said no (it was hashbrown patties). then she got mad i didnt do the dishes even though the dishes are loud asf and i just ran them because i didnt want her to be mad if i forget to do the dishes because shes literally stopping me from doing my chores since theyre all loud. then her medicine is on the front porch anr she demands to know when it arrived when i didnt even KNOW IT WAS THERE. my day is utterly ruined. \n\ni came to walk the dog and she said i better not be standing around messing w my music. I DONT STAND AROUND. the dog sometimes doesnt want to walk so i have to practically drag her. and i DONT constantley adjust my music. she also thinks i only walk to be on my phone and thats not true either i just want to listen to music. now shes always checking on me to make sure im actually walking. \n\ni was using the bathroom yesterday and she stood outside the door asking what i was doing and thought i was LYING. she thought i was cutting but she already took all my blades and i just wanted to use the fucking bathroom. IM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO LOCK ANY DOORS. Im always scared shes gonna burst through the bathroom door while im using it or my bedroom while im getting dressed.  I DONT HAVE ANY GODDAMN PRIVACY. this was before she even knew i cut. she would accuse me of having a second cell phone i bought from a kid at school. I DONT TALK TO KIDS AT SCHOOL. I DONT HAVE FRIENDS. My day was SO good but she fucking ruined it like always. \n\nI am so SICK of this. I tell her to leave me alone. Go away. I want to be alone right now. She doesn't listen. She was in my room and I was SO pissed because she was messing with my room again and she stepped all over my art, crinkling it. I lost it, I pushed her, and she knocked over my ceramic piggy bank by accident. She later said I threw it at her. She had a piece, a shard, stuck in her hand... I said I never threw it but she didn't care. Then she bled on my art and I screamed the second cuss word ever heard from my mouth by a human being. She knew she was bleeding and went over to step on my art AGAIN and BLEED on it. I pushed her again. Look, should I have pushed her? NO. Violence is NOT the answer. But my mind was exploding. I rapidly sorted my art into piles and kept throwing all the 'bad' ones away. I was going CRAZY. (She kept stepping on it because I was near my bedroom door and she sat on my bed, refusing to leave my room because she thought I wouldn't clean it otherwise, and so she was trying to get past me forcefully, even though I was starting to move it out of her way or she could have EASILY stepped over it all. \n\nThat was actually the third time I had to resort to violence. The first was because she was trying to throw away my favorite band sweatshirt, a gift from my bio Mama. I loved that band and that sweatshirt. I cornered her in the hallway to the garage. There's a very big trash can there, and I can't get it back out of the trash can because I can't tip it over due to trash being in it, and I can't reach in because I have short arms and I am 4\"11 at 90 pounds.  I wouldn't have been able to get it back. So I used my body to block her and hold her so I could get my sweatshirt back. \n\nThe other time I resorted to violence, again, she was messing with my art stuff and I lost my mind, scratching and pushing her.\n\nLook, I know it wasn't right... I just don't know what to do. I threatened to run away once, even made a list of what I need and a plan, but she said \"you don't do anything around here, you are disrespectful!\" as if that is supposed to make me want to STAY?? \n\nI am not sure what other big events have happened, I am probably forgetting stuff...\n\nGuys, is it my fault? Am I a bad person, classic teen, yapping about stuff that is not important? I really need help, I don't want to hurt anyone... I need advice.",

I know that they're bad people, but spotify gives barely any money to the artists. Also, I feel like we should just let people be happy. I was on board with not listening to any of them at first, but it just made my depression worse tbh. Just like with Falling in Reverse. It's not like I'm buying a ticket to go to their concerts or meeting and talking to them in person. I think it's okay to be like, \"Hey did you know that they're a bad person? Yes? Okay well,  I don't agree with you listening to them, but I'm not gonna tell you to jump off because of it.\" ",
    60: 'Bernd das Brot (English: Bernd the bread loaf) is a puppet character, star mascot, and pop cultural icon of the German children\'s television channel KiKA,[1][2][3] currently featured in the programs Bernd das Brot, Bravo Bernd, and the KiKA late night loop programme.[4] He is primarily characterised by his chronic depression.[1][3][5]\n\nBernd das Brot puppet and puppeteer Jörg Teichgraeber [de] during an autograph session\nBernd debuted on KiKA in 2000. He became a household name among adult television viewers in 2003 when his broadcasts were played on loop during the hours of 9PM to 6AM, a time during which no regular programming airs.\nRole on KiKA\nedit\nBernd is a depressed and curmudgeonly[3] pullman loaf, speaking in a deep, gloomy baritone.[1] He is small, rectangular and golden brown[3] with hands directly attached to his body,[5] rings around his eyes and a thin-lipped mouth.[6] According to himself, he belongs to the species homo brotus depressivus.[5] His favourite activities include staring at the south wall of his home,[3] memorising the pattern of his woodchip wallpaper, reading his favourite magazine The Desert and You, expanding his video collection of the most boring railway tracks, and eating lukewarm gruel. Bernd sympathizes firstly with himself,[4] and is bad-tempered[7] and fatalistic.[8]\nHis favorite expression is Mist!, used in much the same way as the English "crap".[8][6] His other catchphrases are: "I would like to be left alone," "I would like to leave this show," and "My life is hell."[1][6]\nAccording to his in-universe backstory, the short-armed bread character made his first appearance as part of an advertising campaign for a bakery chain. When the campaign turned out unsuccessful, Bernd was forced to apply for job at the KiKA (more specifically, the MDR member of the ARD) which is also the reason for his permanent scowl. Bernd himself does not want to appear on television and thinks it is a "dirty business".[3]\nThe reason for Bernd\'s depression was revealed in the 85th episode of the series. In his telling: "[...] A long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so unbelievably charming and funny. But unfortunately my affection was in vain. She only had eyes for this perfect stranger, a multigrain bread. It was so devastating. [...] My heart has been a dry clump of flour ever since."\nBernd interacts with two co-main characters. One is the chatty Chili das Schaf ("Chili the sheep"[9]),[3] a female, yellow sheep with flaming red hair. Chili, the show\'s Gastgeberin (hostess), is a Stuntschaf (stunt sheep) who finds it exciting to have close calls with accidents.[6] The other main character is the show\'s technical expert, the always pleasant Briegel der Busch (Briegel the Bush),[3] a green, bespectacled bush with flowers and leaves in lieu of hair. Briegel is an inventor who loves to build complicated devices that almost inevitably explode of their own accord - these devices are usually what is sold on the show.[6] In contrast to Bernd, they enjoy adventures and the excitement of life.[1] Bernd doesn\'t hide that he doesn\'t think very highly of his colleagues, refusing to call them by name (instead calling them "Bush" and "Sheep" respectively) while they treat him as their best friend, even give him nicknames such as "Berndi".\nThe first show starring Bernd, Chili, and Briegel was the 2001 pastiche Tolle Sachen, die einzige Werbesendung auf KiKA (English: Great things, the only advertising show on KiKA) (KiKA is actually a public, commercial-free channel).[6] In this show Chili and Briegel would advertise an object that would be tested by a "randomly" chosen tester that would invariably turn out to be Bernd. Shows with Bernd, Chili and Briegel also include pastiches of Robin Hood, Star Trek, Western and fairy tales.[6]\nProduction\nedit\n\nKrappweis (left) demonstrates the resemblance between Bernd das Brot and his colleague Norman Cöster (right)\nBernd was created in 2000 by Norman Cöster and Tommy Krappweis, of the production company Bumm Film in Munich, Bavaria.[4] KiKA had asked several entertainment companies to create a new sheep mascot, including The Jim Henson Company.[4] Krappweis and Cöster were dining in a pizzeria one night and scribbled sketches on a napkin while watching a bread basket. [4] Cöster said "Bread is funny". Krappweis obtained a square-shaped loaf of bread to which he then gave the face of his colleague Norman Cöster, who also shares many personality traits with Bernd.[4] Upon that idea, Bernd and later on the other figures were developed [10] [11]\nSimilarly, Krappweis himself served as archetype for Chili the Sheep, who - just like Krappweis himself in his earlier years - gets on people\'s nerves with nonsensical stunts, while Briegel the Bush was modeled after a further producer of the series, Michael Briegel. He, too, is said to have a predisposition for wreaking havoc - according to an anecdote, he once set fire to an office computer.\nThe completed character designs of Bernd and Briegel are the work of cartoonist Georg Graf von Westphalen. Bernd is played and voiced by puppeteer Jörg Teichgraeber.\nReception\nedit\nAlthough Bernd was created in 2000, and has been on television since 2001,[6] he first rose to fame in 2003.[7][5] Until then, KiKA was sharing its satellite channel frequency with the Franco-German channel Arte, but after 2003, KiKA got the frequency for itself. As a children\'s channel, KiKA did not air programs between 9pm and 6am, but instead of putting a simple test card, programmers decided to air a late night loop program starring Bernd every night.[7][5][6] In the 2005 version of the program, Bernd constantly stated that he had had enough of television and was going home and advised the viewers to do likewise.[1] The night loop program continues to this day.[4] This program allowed late-night adult viewers to discover Bernd; those viewers would then discuss the bread loaf on Internet forums, buy Bernd-das-Brot merchandising and CDs although none of them were advertised, and participate in Bernd-themed KiKA competitions alongside children.[6] How many adult viewers watch Bernd remains unknown, because KiKA is a children\'s channel whose programs officially end at 9pm and thus no audience measurement is made for KiKA during the night, at the time the Bernd night loop program airs. Furthermore, KiKA\'s main audience being children, adults are not counted even in audience measurements performed during official airing times.[6]\nBernd has thousands of child and adult fans in Germany[3] and is greatly popular.[1][12] Jeremy Wasser of Spiegel Online wrote that "Bernd epitomized the fundamental pessimism felt by many, if not most, Germans about, well, almost everything. (...) That Germans would take to a character like Bernd and be willing to engage in this form of self-analysis and self-mockery should, in my view, be commended. That the people of the land of Goethe and Schiller would choose as their guide in this spiritual exploration a clinically depressed loaf of bread, is, perhaps, just another improbable element of the German Zeitgeist".[1] David Frogier de Ponlevoy, also of Spiegel Online, commented that Bernd shows were "a successful mix of slapstick and irony that irresistibly brings families in good mood."[6] The Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the idea of making a depressed loaf of bread the star of a children\'s channel was crazily funny.[4]\nIn 2004, Bernd das Brot won the Adolf Grimme Award[3] for representing "the right to bad mood" and resisting "the reign of good mood that endlessly drones out of the television".[7][5] The Deutsche Welle commented that "most likely the jury realized just how subversive Bernd das Brot\'s attitude is when many human beings these days are willing to do almost anything to achieve fame and fortune on TV".[3] The Adolf Grimme Award is the German equivalent of the Emmy Award.[3]\nKidnapping\nedit\n\nStatue of Bernd das Brot back in front of the town hall in Erfurt, Germany after its kidnapping\nIn fall 2007,[7] KiKA donated a statue of Bernd to the German city of Erfurt, Thuringia,[12] where KiKA is based,[8] to celebrate the channel\'s tenth anniversary.[5] The statue is 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high,[7] weighs 125 kilograms (276 lb)[5] and is made of plastic.[4] It stands on the Fischmarkt (English: Fish market), the city\'s main square, next to the neo-gothic town hall[8][12] and is a tourist attraction.[5] On 21 January 2009, the figure disappeared.[12][13] It was next seen in a video released on YouTube, in which a group of activists[7] calling themselves "Team 129 A"[8] claimed responsibility for its kidnapping.[8][12] Bernd expressed solidarity with the activists in the video, prompting several media to joke that he had developed Stockholm syndrome.[8][12]\nThe activists were squatting in the abandoned Topf and Sons factory, where ovens and gas chamber ventilation systems for the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp were manufactured.[14] The occupation was to prevent the city of Erfurt from redeveloping the area into apartments and office space.[2][8] They opened a literary cafe and were giving lecture events.[12] The negotiations broke down when the activists rejected an offer for alternative housing.[2][8] The squatters themselves denied involvement in Bernd\'s kidnapping, claiming a group of sympathizers might be responsible for it.[2][7]\nThe public broadcaster Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, which owns the rights to Bernd das Brot, quickly forced YouTube to remove the video from the site[8] by having their lawyers claim copyright infringements.[5] Steffen Kottkamp, head of KiKA, strongly criticized Bernd\'s kidnapping.[8] Krappweis called for the figure\'s return, stating that "Kidnapping, even of bread loaves, is the wrong means of achieving political goals".[12] Fans set up an online petition calling for the return of the statue in Erfurt.[5]\nThe Bernd figure was eventually found intact by chance on 1 February 2009 in the basement vault of a disused barracks in Nohra, between Erfurt and Weimar.[7] According to Spiegel Online, five children had been searching the area to collect period artifacts before it was demolished. They then discovered the Bernd statue and alerted KiKA and the police. How the statue ended up there is unknown.[5] After forensics experts confirmed that it was the genuine statue, it was carried out of the basement by six police officers[7][5][13] and ultimately brought back to its original location on the Fischmarkt in front of Erfurt\'s town hall.\nWorks\nedit\nMusic\nedit\nChart placements\nSingles[15]\n"Tanzt das Brot"\n \tGER\t41\t22 September 2003\t(18 weeks)\t\n"Bernds Balkon"\n \tGER\t88\t9 August 2004\t(2 weeks)\t\n2003: Tanzt das Brot (Single)\n2003: Rockt das Brot (Album)\nChili-TV-Rap / Ich habe ein kleines Cha Cha Cha / Ich sage NEIN / Zu spät / Bluesbrot Bernd / Briegel, komm / Ich will wieder heim / Tanzt das Brot / Saulaut (gesungen von Chili dem Schaf) / Bielefeld / Easy Briegel / Schreit das Schaf (gesungen von Chili dem Schaf) / Buschig, brotig, chilischarf / Geht einfach alle weg / Dubididum\n2004: Bernds Balkon (Single)\nExklusives on Sampler:\n2001: Was geht ab?

    62: "Long story short :\n\nRecently I have been feeling a bit depressed but I think that I'm faking it.. I have reasons for both which I will show here. \n\nThis whole thing has kinda ruined my life for a bit cuz I'm usually the \"funny guy\" people don't expect sth like this out of me. I'm always sitting somewhere thinking about it , never comming up with an answer , I genuinely don't know what to do \n\n\nWhy I thought i was depressed \n\nLoneliness : even tho I'm good with everyone I don't actually have any real friends , people that look forward or want to see me . My \"best friend\" while a great person , doesn't rlly care abt me . he mostly hangs out with other people with me feeling like a last resort. Don't get any wrong ideas here , I'm glad he has other friends , great for him . It's just that it makes me feel like there's a problem with me \n\nAnother problem is that this is the third time I've moved schools , with most of the people here having came from last Yr . They already have their own friend groups , I never had the opportunity to fit in or find new friends bc they were already busy with their own friends.. and you want to know the funny part? \n\nI LIKE BEING LONELY , i genuinely cheer whenever I get to be alone , I love having time to myself , but when that is basically my whole life I just don't know how describe it but it's not nice . And again , I can't talk abt this with anybody cuz they'll feel like I'm joking or they just wouldn't care at all\n\nTerrible grades : last Yr I was up there with the top 5 best students but this year i was absolutely dogshit , like im still putting in all these hours studying but it feels like they have no payoff and im just wasting my time ?!! I wasnt even along side the worst. I was just stuck in below average which was even worse imo , yknow how they say \"third place is the best of the worst\" ? Well I was in second place ( sort of ) \"second place is the *worst* of the best\" and I felt so bad for it..\n\nFortunately it got a bit better with my finals but still , for the entirety of fall , every day was just : more studying _ no time for myself _ same bad grades , repeat\n\n\nWay too much thinking : I feel like I am genuinely unable to be normal , in every single conversation my minds just bouncing around everywhere not letting me focus . I'm always thinking of something , it could be sth serious like my future etc but it can also be : \"the way you walked there looked way too weird\" . It feels like I'm always being judged by someone for every single action , it makes it where I can feel imence guilt over the smallest inconveniences ever . It has made sleeping so much harder cuz my brains just dumping down all of these problems up my throat \n\n I swear to god my brain feels like it's in some sort of civil war with itself , one time I just randomly thought of blinking which made my brain just dip for some reason and then for the next 30 minutes I had to manually blink myself . Fortunately this wasn't the first time sth like this had happened so I knew how to fix it.. I tried to focus and listen to some music but then my brain would imidietly be like : \"\"you are now currently trying to ignore your blinking\"\" . This literally lead to me needing to manually blink for the next few hours or so ?!! \n\nThese things ( plus some more minor ones ) are why I think I was depressed lately...\n\nBut now for why I think I'm faking it \n\n\nWhy I think faking it \n\nTrauma : actually sitting and thinking abt it , I have never rlly experienced anything traumatic ? Sure my parents did nearly get a divorce when I was a kid but still.. , compared to actually depressed people ? Just a short scroll through this sub and you'll see people who've experienced way more Terrible stuff , one guy [18] had just seen her gf commit s#icide and was completely alone for his 19th bday party ?!! I was genuinely so embarrassed after reading that post.. I just imidietly thought : if this whole depression thing is real in the first place , then I must be one soft ass bitch\n\nLike seriously , how would you recover from that ? I genuinely feel ashamed to compare myself with them.... why would I ever become depressed , just bc I don't have any friends ?\n\nAttention bait : sometimes I feel like I'm doing all of this for attention , just a desperate fake play for my own selfish gain , isn't this post technically the same ? Aren't I just asking for validation ? Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing this for the answers and I'm only doing it to see WHY i should feel this way ... i could go on , on why i feel this way but i think you get the point .\n\nAnd at last , doing it bc its what would makes sense : this is by far the weirdest argument that my brain has come up with but I'd thought i could still share it here . Recently I have been watching aton of \"sad\" shows with other depressed characters that ppl might relate to and yeah I def relate to most of them , the problem is that I feel like my brain was just like \" well these are supposed to be relatable characters , so why wouldn't you relate to them more \" which made me unnaturally feel more depressed \n\nYknow at this point I'm just rambling on and wasting your time , I would absolutely appreciate any sort of advice or help cuz this whole thing has been puzzling me for atleast a month....",

SHE ENJOYED IT! For god sakes she asked for my number after. I was amazed and in awe, a girl asked for MY NUMBER!! \n\nLike three months later I transferred to her school, that's when I found out, she had a boyfriend. This was on my first day and I almost had a break down, didn't though cause I'm a MAN!! 💪💪💪 After 3 days, me and him, began to become friends. This is not ideal (kinda forced to be friends he's kinda an asshole). But like a week after Valentine's Day, they broke up. He wanted me to take his side but I just stayed neutral and let it play out but I did support his depression until he started dating a new girl. That's when I fully realized that he was an ass, he told me when they started dating that he is mainly focused on her body, specifically her chest, he said some of these about the girl I liked when they were dating but I just let them slide. Any way me and her (not the new girl were done with her) are in art class, she introduced me to 'avatar the last airbender' while drawing toph for a project. I loved the show and we had one more thing to connect over. \n\nWhile ago, she invited me to go on her boat with her, her dad, two sisters, and her older sister's boyfriend (we know each others but that's not important he's graduated). So, we just went on this boat, broke down, went back to shore and swam for a while, and got Dairy Queen after. We rode home and listened to music, that was that, last time I saw her. That was a month ago. We've had only a few conversations since but she has said more than once at different times we should do it again and that she had a good time.\n\nThis girl is super funny and we just send memes back in forth sometimes, adding on that, she's cute. She has amazing hair and a gorgeous face and I look like a gremlin.\n\nThe big thing, think I'm just a friend that she enjoys being around or is it possible I'm thought of as more. ",
    66: '(attempt 2 of trying to post this, moderators i changed the title to be unique pleaaase let me post this) \n\nmy friend doesnt have reddit and wanted me to post this for her: \n\nim 14 and im starting high school next year and im horrified because of a few reasons: \n\n1. Grades count more in highschool\n\nwhen my parents did the dance with no pants they gave me the worst genes of all time so now im blessed with depression, anxiety, ocd, adhd, and executive functioning disorder (all diagnosed). i barely survived 8th grade and i believe im failing one or two classes because of not turning in multiple assignments and overall lack of motivation. so imagine my shock when i realize my grades are gonna be pretty shitty, and then even shittier after taking the highschool exams, and then realizing its all going to be documented for colleges. i dont care about grades i just want a good job so i can make money. \n\n2. getting my ass jumped\ni might transfer to a really huge ass public school where kids sell drugs and beat each other up 24/7. normally, i wouldnt give a shit,  but i have a loud ass mouth and im probably gonna piss someone off and get beaten up(im like 115lbs and scrawny as fuck, im going to die if even one punch is landed on me - i also cant fight for shit). im not really concerned about the beating up and getting injured as much as looking like an idiot. im also not pretty enough to have some sort of good social status. \n\n3. opps\n\nWARNING: I AM NOT TRYING TO SOUND LIKE AN "IM NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS🥺🥰" GIRL. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT BUT IM REALLY NOT. \n\ni am NOT anywhere near what type of girl is popular and considered cool. I think stanley cups are ugly, i hate lululemon, i hate taylor swift, i dont care for starbucks, i have a messy wolfcut type of hairstyle thats dirty dirty blonde/brunette and not long blonde straight hair or a high messy bun, my mascara is never clumpy like other girls have theirs (and they like it clumpy, which is embarrassing to me), i dont use sol de janeiro, i dont use claw clips, i hate the "preppy aesthetic", i hate scrunchies (they look like buttholes/vaginas), i hate neon pink/purple nirvana sweaters (i would def use it to wipe my ass tho), and my music taste is rock, grunge, and some pop (how do mfs hate rock music??? kiss, van halen, etc on TOP.) \n\nalso, a lot of people think im transgender MTF (i dont think being transgender is a bad thing btw) because i dont act like a girl (i have middle school boy humor, i act like an old white dad obsessed with rock music and making problematic jokes, i never dress in the "clean girl aesthetic", my eyeshadow is always wacky and intense, and all the stuff i listed above). \nHow does this make me transgender? no idea \nJust for you to get a clear image on my personality, i act exactly like dr gregory house (house md) and courtney love. But i also act like bridgette and ginger fitzgerald (ginger snaps), a slight bit like jecka (class of \'09), elle greenaway (criminal minds), Janis and Damian (mean girls),  and more i dont feel like listing. \n\nIm also a "weird kid" by nature. A lot of people call me "emo" blah blah etc etc\nI grew up on "weird kid" things: yandere simulator, melanie martinez, gacha life, etc so idk what that says abt me\n\nIdrc abt being a "weird kid" as long as im not being compared to furries and theater kids. \n\n\nTLDR: i have shitty grades and i suck academically, i might get jumped because i cant keep my opinions to myself, and on the social status pyramid im put in the weird/outcasted section. how will i survive freshman year?

    67: "to anyone who's reading this, this a good story, a couple of things i learnt about life, friendships, relationships, this isn't a sad story, it's just that i've got no one to tell it to, i just wanna share things that life will throw probably at anyone, and there'd be times when you'll be alone, but there's always gonna be someone who's gonna dive in in that pool of shit to help you out, to not let you drown and someone who'll always have your back.\n\nthis is one hell of a story, but i've got no one to tell it to, or no one that'd understand why or what led me to eff up bigtime on my friends, my love life, my parents, my grades (i've got prolly like 5 months before i take the JEE, the engineering entrance test in India). (all names are changed btw)\n\ni'm not gonna say don't judge me or anything, i damn well want y'all's opinion on my story, i'm not ashamed to accept how much of a jerk, an idiot, or how big of a red flag i was, or how pathetic i am for lying, hiding stuff, learning my lesson, yet doing that over again.\n\nhere's me yapping. this story begins before the finals of my sophomore year in high school, since it was just before the finals, barely anyone was coming to the school, i felt lonely, there was another guy, Alex in my class who was similar to me, we became friends, good friends and eventually, best friends.\n\nsophomore year ended strong, we cried, did well on the finals, and were heading on towards the junior year, Alex was no longer in the same class as mine, he had a huge friend circle, probably one of the coolest groups of the entire school, i wanted to be a part of that, so i moulded my personality just to fit in with those popular guys, i wanted to be popular. i made two friends in this way, who were Alex's friends, let's call them Anna and Stella.\n\nin my junior year, i grew a thing for this girl, Natalie who comes on the same bus as mine, i used to text her, talk too her for hours, moulded my personality so that she'd like me as well, and she became a friend. i never had the guts to actually ask her out, so she was the one who did that. thus starts the relationship i'd probably remember for my entire life, it taught me everything abt girls, abt boundaries, abt the importance of communication, being honest, being loyal and being committed in a relationship, i'll always love her.\n\njust a few days down the line, another girl's letter appeared on my desk outta the blue, and i realised it was a girl from the class next to mine. now i'd a friend, Kevin, who'd warned me abt this girl, let's call her Georgina. he'd told me that she's a \"pick me\" girl, and that she'd manipulate me, tell her sad stories and stuff, turns out, he was right all the way, he's always been right.\n\nso every other day, there'd be a letter from her, and i wouldn't just acknowledge her, and one day, i just told her upfront that i'm dating Natalie, and we can just be friends at the very best. i didn't talk to her much, she acted all sad and shit, and vented about me to Stella, her and Stella were friends. Stella and Alex talked to me abt Georgina and suggested me to just \"be friends\" with her. i considered them to be my best friends, and did just that.\n\nnow, Georgina started texting me, talking all kinds of shit, she was overstepping her boundaries, and i was such an idiot to not realise that. she'd send me whole paras, even analysed my handwriting from my test paper (she went out of bounds to get her hands on that), and just flirted with me and i didn't even realise since i was way too naive, and Natalie was my first real gf, and i had absolutely no idea about the concept of \"boundaries\", or even if i did, i was a eff-boy or somn and wanted to eff around ig (it appears to be exactly like that to everyone i know and was friends with), but i'm sure that i was just stupid honestly.\n\nNatalie did know abt those letters from her, but didn't know that i'd been texting her, i just didn't tell her cuz i was afraid of what she might think of me to even thinking about texting a girl who obviously has a thing for me and just pretending to be friends with her. (big red flag, and this is exactly what bit me in the end, all along).\n\nso Natalie had the credentials to my socials (i'd given them to her as part of a trust building exercise, very very important in a relationship, and this is exactly where i've effed up, continuously). and the one time she went through my texts, she read the texts between me and Georgina. ofc she was heartbroken, i apologised so much to her, i kept reassuring her, told her my side of the story, abt how Alex and Stella suggested me to be friends with her, and how i couldn't/didn't want to tell her about it, i accepted my mistake, and promised her to never ever do so again (yet i did), and apologised to her abt betraying her trust, for hurting her, and ghosted Georgina.\n\nso Natalie was the one person who was my bestest friend, my biggest cheerleader, and i'd tell her everything from the bad stuff at my home (it's all good now), to even my most intimate and biggest secrets and insecurities, i trust her with my life, even though i've lost her.\n\nafter the mid-terms (still the Junior year), i grew closer to Alex, Stella and Anna. we were a great group of friends, i considered them to be my best friends, and somewhere along the way, i started prioritising them over Natalie (another red flag). i started telling them everything abt my life, even the the most little thing that'd bug me, and even abt my relationship with Natalie.\n\nso, i've some great parents, idk why but i just hated them at the time, but now i just get how they must've felt/are feeling. they're kinda strict abt dating in high school, as most parents are in India, and are always concerned about whom i hang out with, where do i go, what do i do, etc. now most teenagers would hate that, and probably call them helicopter parents, but at the end of the day, i'm their dear child, they work so hard to earn for me, so that i can study with the best resources, so that i end up richer than they ever were, they always think the best for me.\n\nnow, i'd lie to them about my grades, source edit them online, and just give dumb excuses when the one time (probably one in 50) when they'd actually find out, and i won't study, i'd just binge watch, listen to music, text ppl all day, and just \"pretend\" to study for their sake.\n\nso, in winter, me and Natalie went to the School Carnival, this was probably the only real date we ever went on, and boy it was a lousy one. now the thing is, i'm an ambivert, i'm introverted around new ppl, i'm introverted abt dating in public, but extroverted around ppl i know. so yeah, i was all uptight, and wouldn't even hold her hand and hug her, she felt that i was embarrassed about her, and texted me about that night.\n\nofcourse i ran straight to Alex for help, and i don't know what even happened, somehow it ended with me dramatising abt the whole thing being a \"break up\" (attention-seeking, drama causing, big red flag). soon enough, i reassured Natalie about the whole being introverted and nervous thing. New Years went by.\n\nwe still had some unresolved issues about Georgina, and cleared them the very same night. and my stupid self went on to comment \"hot damn, call the po-lice and the fireman\" to one of Stella's post (it was a public post). Natalie found out abt that and was so heartbroken. i knew no boundaries and just did that outta nowhere, i didn't even see her that way.\n\ni ran straight to Alex, Stella and Anna for help, and talked to Natalie about how it meant nothing (another red flag). somehow, we dealt with that, and it ended up with Stella convincing her how it means nothing. Natalie always resented her.\n\nJunior year finals pass by, my relationship had had it's ups and downs, but it was stable at the time. one day, Natalie would give me an ultimatum to choose between her and Stella, and i told her that i chose her hastily and ran to Alex for help. now him and i tried to convince her to reconsider the ultimatum but couldn't get her to do so.\n\nit ended up with Alex and Stella convincing me that Natalie was being unreasonable here, and we should probably take a month long break from the relationship, and so i did. but i ended that break the very next day cuz i loved her too much, but i didn't have to abide by the ultimatum. they told me that this was the last time they were helping me w my dramatic love life, and the next time we fight, they suggested me to cut ties w her.\n\nnow, all the junior year students go to a school trip for 5 days. and on that trip, one of Georgina's friends, Axel (also Alex's friend) kept asking what'd i think of her, and i was like \"yeah, she's a good person, but i don't see her that way at all.\" then he asked me if i wanted to fix shit with her in such a cunning way that if iwere to say no to that, i'd look like a heartless, effboy jerk.\n\ncooincidently, i broke my dominant arm on that trip, and Georgina was being all so dramatic. she threw such a tantrum that Stella had to beg me to talk to her, i did that, heard to what she had to yap about and went on by my business.\n\ndays past, the Senior year starts off, and Natalie talks to Alex threw a mutual friend, and everyone found out about how i'd dramatised about the carnival incident, and how i'd lied to her about she being the only person i share my insecurities, the oddities life throws at me, and the fights with my parents. i hurt her again, and had no idea how to go by about it, i couldn't even wrap my mind around the idea that she was gonna confront me, and i just shyed away from that and wouldn't even talk to her. i thought abt Alex and Stella told me to cut ties off w her the next time we fight.\n\nthat went on in my head, and i just convinced myself to break it up w her, and even bitched abt her to Kevin, who told me that \"it's not my place to tell you what to do, i don't meddle in relationships, but i told you from day one, that Alex and others are no good\". i still tried to apologise to Alex and the others, Anna was the only one who'd talk to me, but she too got fed up w me and my drama.\n\ni regretted breaking up, i lost my very dear gf, my then best friends, everyone, it was a rough phase, my grades began declining, i'd sit alone, i had a broken dominat arm from the trip, i wouldn't study at all, i resented that, kinda still do but am working on it. Kevin was there w me, he said that \"besties always stay no matter how much a bro ever fucks up, they'll always have the bro's back, and i have ur back\". this made me realise that Alex, Stella and Anna weren't besties to me at all.\n\ni wasn't doing any well academically, and one day my parents actually found out that i'd been lying to them and were so disappointed. i've infinite backlog, i wanna work hard towards JEE. my parents were so heartbroken, they'd been working hard just for me, and i was betraying them. my mom cried, has had sleepless nights worrying abt me. i promised her to work hard, to do well on JEE., and she's been motivating me, trying to help me manage the little time i have until JEE, even tho i've improved, i've started studying just a bit, but it's nowhere near what i can and what i should be doing. it's barely 10% of that, i wanna work hard towards that.\n\ndays past, i'm getting over Natalie, and one fine day, Georgina starts talking to me, telling me how she was right about Natalie being a shitty person (she isn't, not even one bit). i wanted to hate Natalie at the time, so i went on yapping abt her. little did i know, Georgina was manipulating me again, kept telling me abt her sad stories, gained sympathy, and guilt tripped me abt how me ghosting her has caused her grades to slip, how she'd had sleepless nights, how her health detoriated, how she tried doing self harm.\n\nthat guilt got into me quite bad, i'd no idea to deal with it, and started sweet talking (almost flirting) with her, apologising, and whatnot. now this timeline was so hazy, i didn't even realise that me and Natalie hadn't even actually broken up yet. her stupid friend even clicked a photo of me w her (even tho i'm decently away from her, that photo sure looks like i'm staring at that Georgina).\n\nso Natalie texts me we're over, days past by, i'm trying to move on, but couldn't, and still kept texting Georgina (it legit looked like i had a thing for her, but i was just manipulated and guilt struck. i made a new friend along the way, Andrew, the bestest one i've ever had. him and Austin (a guy i've been friends with since we were 7) are my homies.\n\n2 months later, Natalie asks me if i wanna be friends again, i said yes, and the very next day, she said that she'd missed me and wanted us to be a thing again, i said yes to that as well. life was becoming better, or so i thought. the relationship was going smooth this time, i didn't want to repeat the same mistakes again, and ghosted off Georgina again after 4 days we got back together. i didn't tell her that i'd been talking to Georgina, i just didn't want to be in such a difficult situation of losing Natalie again.\n\none day, Natalie sends me a piece of text asking me if i'd sent that to Georgina, and my first instinct was to lie. but in the very next text, i told her, yeah, it was me, explaining my story, saying that it was from when we'd broken up but the dates in my story didn't match (cuz we hadn't broken up officially yet). she got mad at me, confronted me, and i tried explaining her that i didn't ever have a thing for Georgina.\n\nwe dealt w that, and i promised her to yell at Georgina the very next morning that \"i don't want anything to do with her\". sadly, school turned out to be off for the next 2 days (until today).\n\nmy mom found out abt Natalie, she'd always suspected me dating abt her from a letter she found while organising my stuff, she was hurt too that i'd lied to her, hid it from her inspite her telling me otherwise. (second time she found out about me dating, first one was back in Sophomore year from a so-called relationship that was just to show-off and be cool in high school).\n\nnow, she told me to get rid of my insta, and i pretended to do just that, and didn't even come online yesterday and even today. but i knew that i had to deal with the fight w Natalie. she and Georgina exchange texts meanwhile, Georgina sends her all screenshots in which it appears like i'm flirting with her, basically cheating on Natalie just before the break up. (i find it so weird that Georgina is doing it now, 2 whole months after we got back together, and even tho i've lied and hid stuff, i'm being framed by her, she even told her that i danced w her on the trip which isn't true at all). even tho i was pretty shitty, but i'm sure Georgina is manipulating her against me, she knew damn well that i texted her out of guilt, i made sure that one of her friends, Aaaron knew abt it.\n\nnow, i tie up Andrew in the crossfire, i didn't tell him abt the content of those texts to Georgina, but he basically knew what had been. Natalie talked to him last night, sent him those screenshots and he was very pissed at me that i'd been lying to him as well.\n\nhe calls me up today at noon, confronting me, i told him my version of the story, abt the whole guilt tripping, manipulating, and sent him screenshots between me and one of Georgina's friends (Aaron) clearly stating that i had no such thing for her, and was doing so just outta guilt. i had deleted all texts relating to Georgina, but ended up recovering the ones that'd show my pov, the pov which is highly reasonable, full of stuff that i hid from and lied about to Natalie.\n\nmy parents are heartbroken, Natalie's heartbroken, Andrew is pissed at me (but still is helping me w Natalie since i'm not using insta outta guilt cuz my mom found out, and probably is the last time will ever help me since i lied to him as well). Natalie is broken to the point that she even texted Andrew and Austin from my account sharing all those screenshots and that photo of me with Georgina.\n\nit appears that i'd been cheating on Natalie, there's no way she's gonna stay, the best i can hope for is that we break up on good terms, she's gonna talk to me about the whole thing tomr and i've no idea hwat i'm gonna do or say (pretty sure i won't even be able to look at her let alone talk to her, Andrew texted her from my side providing my pov. i was giant red flag, and i regret all the shit i did. even though it looks all bad, i learnt a whole lot from it and would remember it for the rest of my life. i'll always love Natalie\n\nthe lesson i learnt all along was that you can never buy your way out of difficult situations just by hiding or lying stuff, sooner or later, all the shady stuff that you've did is unearthed and you're much worse than you could've been if you could've just accepted and told the truth in the first place. i feel bad about what i did to my parents. the key to any sort of relationship (be it a s/o, parents, friends, etc.) is honest and true communication. and communication becomes key especially in difficult times, when ur grades are bad, when u feel lonely, when it feels like the end of life, when you feel guilty, when u're down the wrong path. instead of pushing these feelings away, it's better to talk about them with your closest ppl be it anyone, bit someone's gotta know that you're not okay, esp when you're down the wrong path.\n\nthere'll always be some one ready to jump into that pool of shit you're drowning in, to help you out. and life isn't hedonistic at all, you gotta earn your place, you gotta dream big, aim high, and work goddamn hard towards it (i'm saying this while having infinite backlog and preparing for JEE). there's no easy way ever, there'll always be ups and downs, we just gotta make sure that those downs don't kill our spirit, our dreams, or just depress us to the point we feel like doing nothing.\n\nnow, after all of this, i wanna be a better person, i wanna work hard towards my dream of getting into a good college, i wanna study for 12 hours straight, i don't wanna lie anymore, i wanna be brutally honest, be truthful, be humble, be polite, be respectful towards everyone. i wanna get rid of procrastination (doing exactly that rn), get rid of my poor attention span, enjoy studying, be happy, enjoy the hard and cruel journey towards my dream, not being wound sad ever along the way, and just be happy.\n\ni'm sorry for typing out such a long story, i hope that you learnt something from it and don't make the same mistakes i did, and just be happy and healthy.\n\nTLDR: i'd been a sociopath, i lied to my friends, my parents, hid stuff from my s/o, stopped studying, lied about my grades, learnt a life lesson, and wanna be a better person now, work towards my dream and not procrastinate, and wanna be happy, everyone deserves to be happy.\n\nUpdate: Natalie and I fought for 2 days, she said she wanted space and wouldn't text me back and asked me to not text her, that's what i did. Andrew's been busy w his stuff, we have an upcoming exam, he's been studying for that, we haven't talked yet. Last night, Natalie said that maybe we should end things cuz they aren't working out, and we can stay friends and maybe date later on if we still feel the same way about each other. yeah, things ended on good terms ig.",

We both said that we trusted each other so much after that. We text every single night for hours yet he doesn't like me. I might even love him. He likes another girl and is really in love with her and has been for years. We share music playlists with each other and talk about EVERYTHING. Nothing is off limits at all. From periods to sex to depression, we talk about everything. He's my best friend yet I feel insignificant in his eyes. He's always hurting me but it's probably an accident. We BOTH said smash to each other in smash or pass and literally wrote essays to each other on why (he wrote more than I did and it was awesome) and that really messed w my head bc why is he leading me on if we are just friends? Also he said one time to make his point \"we don't even text that often\" when we literally text on a DAILY BASIS. That really hurt my feelings. He also takes like 15m to respond to my first few texts in a conversation. I always get so jealous too when he talks to me about other girls that he likes. I think he doesn't like me bc I'm out of his league and not his type (he goes for white and pretty ppl and I'm not either) even tho he's told me a million times that looks don't rly matter to him. He did call me pretty when we were having a convo about our insecurities and stuff and also in the smash essay paragraph thing. But I'm actually ugly and he's hot and popular. Even tho he's popular, he's an absolute sweetheart. He said period blood isn't gross, it's just blood. He also bought chocolate for a random girl once bc she had period cramps!! He told me that my future soulmate is extremely lucky to have me- multiple times. I just feel so confused with him and need advice on what to do/how to deal with this.

I just turned 18 literally a week ago, so I'm a bit late to the party but I've wanted to go on here for the longest time to see what my peers are up to. I guess I'll start with the general stuff.\n\nMy favorite music artists are Tame Impala, Michael Jackson, Foo Fighters, and honestly the list goes on forever but what can I say, music is my life.\nI sing and play keyboard, and I dabble with bass guitar here and there. My favorite games include the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise, specifically 1-5 because after that the story got a little too convoluted for my liking, Death Stranding for the PlayStation, really solid story and gameplay throughout, and I also play a lot of Mario games on my switch. Also I will say I really enjoy the insomniac Spider Man games, I have played 1 and 2 plus Miles Morales.\n\nI have severe depression and social anxiety, might be a misanthrope but I can't say for sure. If I'm feeling suicidal I will just stay in bed all day and try to sleep the day off, I've tried to commit suicide once before but I guess it wasn't my time to go.\nUm what else,\nMy favorite fast food restaurant is Popeyes but my favorite food ever is probably Southside Six which is located over on the South Side of Bowling Green, excellent Mediterranean food. Highly recommend if you're in Ohio.\n\nYou could call me a loner, I mean I distance myself from people as much as I can, I just don't feel like they will add to my life, but then again maybe I haven't met the right people yet. Maybe I will meet one of those people on here. But maybe I won't.\n\nHowever I'm a big believer that all of you on here are young beautiful talented individuals, and don't let anyone make you think otherwise. You have your whole life ahead of you and you have so much time, as do I, to accomplish your goals and aspirations. All of you have potential to do amazing things. You deserve happiness and you deserve to live a life you want to live without anyone giving you shit for it. Keep your head held high.\n\nBlake out",

    78: "tl;dr : im not following the \"normal\" way in practically anything and i am, to put it mildly, not ok with it.\n\n\nas i get closer to the age of m18 (borderline minor) and university life, i have yet to experience things other people did basically for granted. im just blank. to me personally it feels like i have no personality. no idea what other people think of me though, but they are not the main problem. today i talked to my broskis on discord as per usual, when one of them mentioned how old games were better than new AAA titles. i asked him to define what \"old\" game is. he said those would've been stalker series, gta, need for speed and some other racing games, dying light etc.\n\nit didn't *hit* me with the fact that i didn't know those games' names, i had it in my mind that i've never played any GTA in my life and i wouldn't say i have a flaming desire to. but he was shocked. it felt like in his mind it was so baked in for all gamers to have at least once in their life complete GTA:SA.\n\nthere's a lot more to say in this branch of same character. i barely have any hours on CS and can't relate to people complaining about how csgo was golden and how much cs2 sucks compared to it. i can't say for sure if i have ever slain ender dragon in MC in survival. im not sure if i have even a quarter of some sort of essential bucket list crossed out. i did play a lot of flash games when flash player was still alive, i even installed flashpoint to pay a visit to some of my favourites. but even HERE i have white spots, there are flash games that probably everyone but me has played and unfortunately i have no desire to try them.\n\nso that was just gaming. precisely, PC gaming, since i only played console at my friends' places, definitely not enough to develop some feelings. i've had this in my head for a while and realised that there are also books, many books that i should have read by now, but i didn't. in some of them i have no interest. same with films and TV series.\n\nnext branch would be music, although it's a lenient one for me. i have already accepted the fact that my music taste is a bit more niche than everyone else's in my surroundings. however the very first musical instrument that i decided to give a try was.... diatonic harmonica. very obscure choice, considering the difficulties it has compared to more \"normal\" instruments. im trying to make progress on it and i do make it, but it's no secret that many people absolutely HATE the sound of it. why didn't i try other stuff then? piano seemed boring as hell to me. guitar i simply didn't try just yet, might give it a shot later in the future.\n\nthe next thing is probably sport and other similar activities. i don't understand the gimmick of playing or watching football (soccer if you're american reading this), i didn't stick with the martial arts. i spent 5 months practicing kickboxing (idk, can it be called sports club?), almost a year in aikido and none of those did i get hook on. so my mom decided to yeet me in the billiard club and honestly... it might look like im having fun but deep inside me there's something telling me that it's not my thing despite the fact that im going there for almost 4 years so far. i signed up for the gym in february but initially it was because i felt like i had to. i had this relatively basic idea of bodybuilding at least something worth looking at. and you know, physical activities can help with mental health a bit. im not making much progress there, but this is a tiny part where i can be at least thankful that i did something.\n\nhell, even food is a hard topic imo. everyone around me has absolutely no problem with eating, their weight is in normal condition. and then there's me who manages to survive on solar energy, sometimes for 12 hours without my stomach aching.\n\nand im not gonna start on relationship branch. i simply didn't reach a certain level yet to have a gf and tbh there's nothing to be angry at myself for. though i do have at least one person whom i can call a true friend.\n\nthe obscurity of my hobbies is.... undeniable. who ON EARTH would deem me interesting when i play billiard, chess and harp (just to seem normal, ignoring the fact that i do that poorly), along the fact that i have never played CoD or even watched Fight Club? i can't even think of any significant achievement of mine to bring up in a dialogue.\n\nwhen talking to other people i got used to memorizing details from films i never watched, the lore of the games i never played and covering up the holes in myself which would otherwise lead to marking me a NPC and \"boring person\". the solution to this seems easy: just go experience it all right now.... but it's only like that on paper. im fed up with this feeling of not knowing what i like, even though im barely making any moves to fix that.\n\n\nsumming it up, i wouldn't say this is a cry for help. it's just a bullshit state of mind i've been in for the past two years.\n\ni sincerely apologize for the amount of depressive boring shit of a complaint that i've just spent maybe an hour on.",

    86: "I don’t have much to say as a foreword but this might be a pretty long list. The genres generally fall into rock, with a bit of swing, rap, and some stuff where I really don’t even know the name of the genre is how alt it gets. So instead of sticking to genres I’m just gonna give a brief description of the vibe. You should also know I'm woefully ignorant of genres, so I may just get stuff completely wrong. Please help.\n\nAlso, I don’t really listen to artists as much as I listen to individual songs I like (indie stuff is pretty hit or miss because they don’t need to pander to an audience; blessing and a curse), so each artist is gonna have my favorite songs. I encourage you to ignore me and try all of it. With that out of the way here is list. If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing just comment what your vibe is and I can recommend.\n\nThe Vanished People: My most recent discovery, and inspired the making of this list. The songs vary widely, but share a bright rock vibe driven by guitar, bass, and vocals. The lyrics range between soulful and fun, but are always interesting. Favorite songs are Glass Moon Dance and Queen of the Night. This shit is so good it literally pulled me out of depression. I wish that were an exaggeration.\n\nFelix Hagan and the Family: On directly the opposite end of the spectrum, Felix is about the edgiest I’ve got. Very drum and bass heavy tracks supporting similarly heavy lyrics. This shit is so edgy they’ve got a song called Delirium Tremendous. Oh you know, just a pun on *fatal alcohol poisoning.* That and On the Double are my faves.\n\nFever Dolls: The only song of theirs I like is Gennifer Flowers. It’s very hard to explain this one, so give it a listen if you want. Bass-heavy and hectic.\n\nThe Brobecks: Referred to as indie pop (isn’t that an oxymoron? Anyway), these guys are guitar-heavy with some guy absolutely murdering the drums (but they have good audio balancing so it’s not bad). They mix in a fun bit of piano between loud and heartfelt lyrics. You can tell I’m a sucker for good lyrics. Anyway, I like Better than Me.\n\nAir Traffic Controller: indie pop again (I'll stop questioning it, fine) with a lot of EDM and driving drums, plus some tasteful piano. Their first three songs jump from toxic relationship to insomnia to \"shit I gotta get to work\" and somehow the last one is the saddest so you just know these lyrics are incredible. Big fan of Creature of the Night and Hurry Hurry.\n\nDirt Poor Robins: back to indie rock, these two combine profoundly sad lyrics with much more upbeat piano, drums, brass... I mean everything but strings really. I'm not sure how to describe them, it's very grandiose and yet sad, indomitable human spirit style. I like Lady Hell and Enchante\n\nAnybody who's made it this far probably already knows about Will Wood, but this is here just in case. If you don't know Will Wood... fix that.\n\nSteam-Powered Giraffe: No, don't double take. This is an indie list, you knew it had to get weird. Pretty obviously these guys are a steampunk theme band (they actually perform in full costume, but I'm not a concert guy so never been. Feel free to flame me for not going to concerts, my friends will do it better). These guys have such an unprecedented amount of quality and quantity for a smaller band, and despite being steampunk they have plenty of excellent music that completely ignores the theme. I'm a fan of I'll Rust With You, Shattered Stars, and Latum Alterum.\n\nDemondice: It's edgy again! Japanese/English rap, so I don't understand half of it, but it's supported by exciting tracks that range between jazzy and airy. The lyrics are, as far as I know, pretty dark and sometimes sorrowful. I'm a fan of Hazy Skyscraper and Dark Hour.\n\nJukebox the Ghost: I'm not sure what these guys are doing, apparently they're power pop and I don't know what that means. Whatever it is, Ramona and Under my Skin have lyrics that I really enjoy, and whoever's singing is absolutely killing it. Lots of bouncy piano, light drum and guitar.\n\nJharaih: Very high-octane punk that leans heavily on vocals thanks to an absolutely beautiful voice just screaming his lungs out. The instruments are hectic and accelerated. A must listen for anyone who likes punk... anything really. I like Risk Risk Risk, A Lesson in Dramatics, and Pressure Bomb.\n\nFish in a Birdcage: You will get turned off by the fact that the first song is called Rule #34. You will then quickly realize this was an inevitability, as every single song is called Rule #X. This is natural. Jokes aside, each song varies, from the old-timey piano of Rule 15 - Four Aces to spirited violin of Rule 4 - Fish in a Birdcage (my two favorites, Rule 4 being one of my all-time favorites. I relate to it.) Most songs have at least some smooth and uncluttered violin, but what ties them all together is the love poured into every single lyric, and the buttery voice of our protagonist. Each song is a story and world all on its own.\n\nGood Kid: More popular than most on this list, but what matters is that it's good, not that it's indie. I think you  might have actually heard these guys if you're on Twitch often, since they don't issue strikes. Anyway, these guys make high-energy, guitar-driven rock with fun lyrics. The kind of thing you listen to at 1:30AM on an electric scooter. Because that's obviously a universal experience. I like Mimi's Delivery Service, No Time to Explain, First Rate Town, and Witches.\n\nDom Fera: I'm not 100% sure how to describe it, and clearly he doesn't either bc I can't find a lick of info besides the fact that he's also a writer and director. Nothing super special going on musically, but I just absolutely love the lyrics. My favorites are Nothing to Say, Breathe, and Monster Song.\n\nRyan Ike: Despite being a video game soundtrack artist, this man consistently produces bangers in low, soulful strums of western guitars and the excellent vocal talent that his sponsors pull in. He's made music for the West of Loathing Series and Wizard with a Gun, but by far his best music is from the least well-known title, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine. I like Heavy Hands and Vagrant Song the most. If you like the country vibe but not the modernized version that appears in today's music, give him a listen. Also try the game, it's not much, but it has soul. (and it's cheap as dirt too lmao, on sale for like 2 bucks periodically)\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie: Fairly well-known for an indie band, this is the part of the list where my vinyl-obsessed brother's influence begins to bare its teeth. Death Cab for Cutie makes mellow music with overlayed guitars and gentle drums, just to support lyrics that are absolutely full of soul, sorrow, and hope. Genuinely enough to make you cry. I like Asphalt Meadows, Here to Forever, and Soul Meets Body.\n\nCosmic Johnny: And in the opposite direction, one of the smallest on the list, this guy's got less than 10k monthly listeners. As indie as they come. Not be confused with Johnny Cosmic, who I did not know existed until they took over my search results. lol. Anyway this is pretty basic punk rock, but for some reason it just resonates with me. I love the lyrics, they really mean something and clearly are personal. I like Sleep with a Baseball Bat and Useless Machine. Yeah, punk shit.\n\nThe Crane Wives: Folk indie band with lots of pretty chords and plucked strings, as well as haunting backup vocals and beautiful harmonies. Each song tells a story, as befits a folk band. I find it very relaxing to listen to while driving. My favorites are Take Me to War (so relaxing, huh?) and Metaphor.\n\nThe Unlikely Candidates: These guys do whatever they want, and the only song I really like is Danger To Myself (please do not worry for my mental health; as mentioned before, that is being dealt with). It's rock, it's alt, it's punk, it's loud and proud and has some truly outstanding vocals.\n\nJack Cambell: Also very very small indie, Jack's work is surprisingly light and airy for what is ostensibly a punk rock band. It feels like it really leaves room for what they want to say to be heard, which is good because their lyrics are sad and soulful. The whole experience feels like looking up at the sky in the middle of a city. It's heavy, but also a breath of fresh air. I like Absentee, Home Alone, and Scared of Heights.\n\nCamino 84: I am truly honored to be one of less than 20k people who listen to this guy on the monthly because holy hell is it some of the best music I know. Staccato funk guitar, disco vibes, and powerful but understated bass, the music itself is a smooth groove. The lyrics are serious, meaningful, and beautifully written. Please listen to this stuff, I love it and you just might. Favorites are Little Too Late, Responsible, and Never Be Alone.\n\nGo! Child: I think this might be the last on the list, but you probably know better than I do since you can see the end, and I'm writing. Would be pretty funny to not stop here, huh? Well, Go! Child is a very electronic indie pop thing. I only really like Good Morning and Atlanta, both from their album Coffee and Ramen. It's very hit or miss stuff, but give them a shot if you like chiptune with some actual lyrics.\n\nThe Postal Service: Not the end, I totally forgot these guys. More of my brother's vinyls, this is also electronic indie, just better. It's very much one of those signpost indie bands. Look, just listen to Such Great Heights and you'll see what I mean. It's hard to describe.\n\nRare Americans: These guys deserve more attention. It's alt rock and, look, I know I keep harping on about lyrics and lyrics and such, but these are something special. Their songs really touch on the complexity of human life in an unprecedented way. Each one is brimming with hope and despair, and you can really feel the voice of the masses through their music.\n\nAnd there you go! Basically my whole spotify library.

I also had one other girlfriend previously from a year and a bit ago, so already off the bat I don’t have much dating experience. \n\nI also have a burning passion for the railroad. It’s what I want to do out of high school. It’s what I keep the most tabs on, and what immerse most of my free time in. Trains are my life and I take great joy in observing and learning about them. \n\nOther things about me include my music taste and sense of humour. I really like clowning around and making people happy with various types of humour from bland dad jokes to darker than a badger’s asshole jokes. I really like various musical artists and genres.\nI like classic 60s&70s rock and roll like Creedence Clearwater Revival, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Boston, Queen, etc. I also like some 2000s and 2010s music like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Rihanna, etc. I also love 80s metal and ABBA. So trains are not my entire personality but a really big chunk of it.\n\nI do have also have ADHD and some minor mental health issues. My ADHD can make me a little hyper, annoying, anxious, depressed, irritable, and other things. I’m called annoying, stupid, and amongst many other things which some of them I agree with. I have a hard time accepting and believing in myself, most days I hate myself and I listen and believe all the negativity that is thrown at me. My body image and how I view it is very left and right. Some days I can’t stop shaming myself and some days I am really admiring myself. This has been an ongoing problem that I have struggled with and gotten used to. I know it isn’t health and I have taken it upon myself to change how I view myself. \n\nWhat are some personal and physical qualities that I can acquire to make myself look better as a person?",

    91: "TL;DR, Got friend zoned and I didn't care, now I feel like shit.  \n  \n**For those who have the attention span of longer than that of a Gen Z I-pad kid, here's the full story:**  \n\n\nLast year, I (16 at the time) Began to date my current ex (15, but would be 16 in a month) Mid-June. Come October, she broke up with me. It sucked. Loneliness, depression, constant feeling that I'm not good enough for anyone, yada yada yada.  \n\n\nFast forward to last week. I (Now 17) and the entirety of my schools musical cast are gearing up for our first shows and going through our final dress rehearsals. I was lucky enough to land a somewhat major lead. The female lead of my cast (18) and I had been nervous for ages, but after a couple of really solid dress rehearsals, we both felt very confident. However, nobody knew that I had feelings for her, and had them for at least 2 months.  \nI tell one person. That turns to two, to four etc. Eventually, basically everybody in the cast aside from the female lead I like and a handful of other people who want no business in my business knew.  \nI said I didn't care if she found out. The very first person I told talks to her over snap and, with me waiting with bated breath, tells her of my little crush on her.  \nI got friendzoned. Now, this isn't what hurt me the most. It's how I reacted to being told this news.  \nI was in full \"It is what it is\" mode.   \nThis hurts me. I hold love as an incredibly high value, and to see me brush it off in this manner makes me feel like the scum of the earth. I feel like I've quit trying to find actual love for some reason. I feel like being rejected or accepted by someone for my longing for them doesn't matter, as if I'd date them because I had the slightest interest in them. Now, I don't know what to do with myself. Yay.",

Some of you may still be in the situation even now, or at least in a situation where you spend your time with people who don't understand or even really like you.\n\nAt one point I befriended a classmate who was completely different from me and a polar opposite by just playing roblox with him. Somehow we ended up getting closer and we got each other through the worst times and even learned a lot from each other. He used to be homophobic and when we hung out with a person I know that is part of the lgbt he found out that they're just as nice as anyone else making me feel so proud when he defended my gay friend from some douchebags who think they're better than him for \"not being gay\". We are currently best friends.\n\nEven one time when I was alone outside, I managed to get the courage to talk to a person who was visibly into \"weirder\" stuff (by weird we're talking anime or \"unusual\" music) and he, to this day, accepts me the way I am and never once judged me on things I can't change or my rather obscure interests.\n\nPlease trust me when I say that there will *always* be someone who wants to be your friend despite some of your bad traits. Even if you're depressed, even if you listen to music that most people don't like or listen to, even if you don't like the stuff they like, even if you consider yourself \"ugly\".\n\nOne thing that I personally recommend is using the line \"worst thing that may happen is them saying no\" when you feel unable to go up to a person you find interesting for if they decline, you have a lot more people whether it's irl or online. Also, if you want to fit in more, try and take interest in things that are common wherever you live. Maybe I don't like the movies my best friend or the music he listens to but I will gladly do my research and show interest in things he likes. By doing that I managed to, in a way, \"befriend\" the person that bullied me for many years and we even hung out (in a group) a few times.\n\nAll I'm saying is that *you* are the only one who can fix your problems and it's up to you to become the person you'd like to be little by little. Don't set high expectations as none of us are perfect, just try to aim towards being a likeable human being.\n\nI only wish love for all of you and hope it helped everyone (or at least most people) who took the time to read this.\n\nKeep your hope up, even if it's little",

    95: "Im really doubting myself right now. I always did my best in school and I really was like the kid every parent liked I never did anything forbidden or broke any rules. But I got depression at 14 cause of school and now I don't know if I have lived the live I wanted too live and it seems too late now. I have my most important exams in the next months and I turn 18 in Summer and I kinda just listen to depressing music now every night and blame myself for not living my teen years. Most of the times I said no to party's or stuff like that just to study and now I will have good grades and I'm sure I will get a great career but this seems like a loosing trade cause I really regret not living my teen years and having serious depression in most of them. I am really doubting myself why I still go through live please help me",
    96: "read this if ur feeling hopeless so I knock sense into u \n\nI don't feel like life is meant to be suffering. I don't think we should spend the rest of our lives believing that we are meant to suffer and nothing else. I like what Viktor Frankl said- \"If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an eradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.\" \"The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life.\" (Totally recommend looking into this guy if you are having an existential crisis.)\n\nDon't read that if you don't want to lol, but basically I can't go about life believing that we can't accept good because there is suffering. A lot of people on this subreddit are young, and already accepting horrible beliefs that will probably dictate the rest of their life. You aren't meant to be sad, honestly, it's pathetic and useless to see life that way. I'm quite literally clinically depressed with a genetic imbalance of my serotonin levels, but after years of failing and crying and living in the cave that my room had become, I realized that I was already dead. I had loved nothing and felt nothing, I was basically a corpse in a breathing skin. We have eternity, eventually, to be dead, so just spend this short time to live. You won't experience it again, lol.  You aren't meant to vape and be a drug addict and live with an ed and become an early alcoholic. You aren't meant to die alone and be hated by your family and be a victim to capitalism. Dude, shut up and do something with your life, it's getting annoying. Just live.\n\nDo what makes you happy (and no, you don't find happiness in hurting your body through harmful coping mechanisms). Find what actually makes you happy. You have to come to a point in your life where you realize that you have a lot of control over the way your life will unfold. Stop blaming your sadness or trauma on others. I promise that it is truly not your fault that you've become this person with a really painful past, but it is your fault if you let yourself stay this way.\n\nI hope you guys get what I mean and it doesn't fly over your head, but I want everyone to know it isn't hopeless. Life isn't hopeless unless you accept it to be, tbh. You can continue calling people delusional for changing their perspective on a situation but if that's delusion, then we are all guilty of it.\n\nOne more devious quote, by Einstein- “everything is energy and that’s all there is to it. March the frequency of the reality you want and you can’t help but get it. It can be no other way. This is not philosophy, this is physics.” I’m not talking about weird wizard stuff, it’s the idea that you can make your life whatever you want it to be. It’s just a sort of law of the universe that you will notice/find stuff bad or good if you look for it. Stop being a pessimist, unless, of course, you are a masochistic mf who doesn’t want happiness and deep down has already lost their soul and any ounce of humanity. Then whatever, be miserable, I don’t care. Just wanted to remind some people who still have faith in theirselves that you can live a good life. Suffering will happen, but life isn’t about suffering, it’s about your reaction and perseverance to it. If you stayed until the end of this, I applaud you. Now go read a book or something. Lower your 18 hour screen time lol. (Also talking to myself here.)\n\n\nSome stuff to do to be happy:\n\nFind a side hustle to make money in a way that makes you proud and isn’t corrupt. (Money=security. Security=good.)\n\nDo something hygienic lol, take a shower, or paint your nails (despite ur gender lol), or shave- do something that makes you feel like you look good. \n\nActually workout in a fun way. You don’t have to torture yourself, go on a hike or drive to a rock climbing wall. Find exhilaration and enjoyment in whatever you experiment in. \n\nNot to sound corny to some of you but deadass pick up a piece of paper and write down everything that’s on ur mind. Journaling isn’t cringy, it really stops the jam of thoughts in ur brain. Just try. Burn the paper afterward if you want. I have been writing down whatever bothers me for like 3 years and it never failed to help me figure out why I do what I do.\n\nGo to therapy…tbh. Or just research psychology and trauma responses so you understand your identity and your “flaws,” and how they came to be. \n\n\nCook. Try making orzotto with spinach sauce. Or bake tiramisu, idk. Cooking is an awesome skill for all people.\n\n\nArt. Draw cartoons or album covers, paint an apple, or a funny picture with Drake but instead of Drake it’s an apple. \n\nWatch Deadpool. Both of em. how couldn’t you be happy after seeing Ryan Reynolds\n\nMake something. Be proud of it. Make a piece of music or write something, make a collection of moths idk, just do something.\n\nI cannot stress this one enough- put ur phone high up where you can’t reach, then leave your room and sit somewhere with the most nature accessible. If ur scared of social settings, go somewhere private. If you can’t access the outdoors, go to a window. And just stare, especially during sunset or sunrise. Grandmas know what they are doing. It’s high-key so fun to just be around a beautiful setting and think. Don’t hate it until you try it. \n\nPut your headphones on a reasonably high volume and play one of those songs with the best bass drop ever and dance, it’s really a euphoric feeling… I like it better than drugs 💀\n\nTalk to a friend. But a friend that doesn’t shit on u, and instead actually makes you feel like you are uplifted and able to grow. Never try to be the best person in your friend group. You don’t need an ego boost, you need to be in a healthy environment where everyone has strengths. Laugh with somebody. \n\nDo something with your siblings or parents if u are close. Something as simple as watching a sitcom can go a long way. \n\nGo somewhere cold then jump into your bed with socks on and wiggle under the covers like a bug then make fake scenarios in your head where you are living ur dream life. Because it’s kinda fun to imagine. And it makes the possibility of it a little bit more real, I think. \n\nScroll through r/ wholesome memes \n\nAlso leave all of those subreddits that you are just there to oversee the absolute bafoonerie of the people within it. The more you surround yourself with shitty people, the more shitty of a person you become. \n\nWatch Danny Gonzalez , or those Mr beast videos that are actually really sweet and make u tear up just a lil \n\n\nDo 29 pushups. \n\n\nAre these becoming more unhinged? I’ll just stop there but lemme know if you want any more happiness suggestions. Bye, don’t kill yourself. Hold it out a little longer so you can buy alcohol legally. \n\n",
    97: "Most people tell me to get therapy and stuff like that but I hate talking about my problems and I just feel like I’m falling through a dark hole I can’t get out of, and I dont want to be home this whole week because I don’t want to feel alone, and idk what to do anymore, this feels dumb to try, but I just wanted to talk about it here",
    98: "I liked it. I liked the lockdown too. I was introverted and back then I didn’t play sports. So who cares? Plus I got to laugh at the extroverts \n\nI was in grade 9 and the work was dumb easy. Among us was active(and those among us streams too), fall guys was active, I watched a ton of dr lupo’s steams, and I listened to nostalgic depressing music. Plus I binged alot of anime and I had so much time on my hands. I even had the time to play Roblox for 5-6 hours if I was staying home since school was online. I could also just do whatever in school since it was online, so I could eat, or minimize the class sometimes. It was basically a free for all tbh \n\n2020 is overhated . It really wasn’t bad at all, for me personally",

I’ve only moved once but I remember it being the worst thing ever, because I had to leave everything and go somewhere completely unknown. I didn’t manage to get my life back together for three years. My advice is to just try and get involved in things, even if you feel like you won’t be welcome, try to find people you can relate to or just who are nice to you. My way of doing this was joining my school band, back in middle school when I moved, and now I’m a marching band and winter color guard member, and I’ve made so many friends because of it, most people wouldn’t believe how much anxiety I actually have. I know band isn’t really an option halfway through high school, but just try and find an activity like that, it really really helps', \"You are growing up with time. There is nothing bad happening with you. You'll rock one day bas back yo reality and catch your consciousness.\", 'So at some point, I low-key felt the same way. Ofc instead of liking anime, I liked Star Wars (I still do). Instead of going into art and YouTube rabbit holes, I spent my time playing piano and learning math for fun(I still do). I’m lucky enough to go to a relatively non-religious school, and I’ve never been diagnosed with depression (though I was often suicidal in middle school). I live in a different country than you do, but I also do not really keep up with pop culture/trends. I’ve literally had people call me antisocial because I said I don’t like parties/large crowds, they give me anxiety. I also am not exactly a looker. I’m short and skinny and have no real dressing sense, lol. But mental-health wise, I’m doing relatively fine and I do have friends so I might be able to help you out a bit. \\n\\nSo here’s one thing. Stop trying to make yourself more “like” others. Unless it’s a genuine change of character, it’s painfully obvious and will just make you look desperate. Most people don’t want to be friends with people who are desperate. I would suggest exploring more popular hobbies as you might like them, but don’t force change on yourself because it’s probably not going to work. Even if it does, it’ll only be temporary and you won’t be happy. Believe me, I’ve tried.\\n\\nAnother thing…high school relationships really aren’t worth it. I’ve seen so many people waste time on relationships and the heartbreak that follows, and that’s not counting those who get STDs/pregnant. Most high schoolers are both immature and overemotional and combining those with the feelings associated with dating is a recipe for disaster. Most of those girls you see in relationships? They’re going to break up and be rly sad about it. Don’t waste your time with that bullshit.\\n\\nIf you want to make friends, just be genuine. It’s easier said than done, but believe me when I say that people appreciate others who are not fake. Like I tried so hard to please people in middle school and it just did not work. But when I stopped being afraid of speaking my mind (within reason, ofc) I started making friends. This does have its drawbacks, as it’s possible to say something too controversial and suffer social consequences. But it overall helps imo.\\n\\nAlso, take difficult classes and do well in them. Like be among the best in your school, and you’ll find others like that. School itself will be your common interest with a lot of people, and that can be a springboard to more meaningful friendships if you share other interests. Don’t let yourself be used or anything, but give and take help as needed. As a bonus, this will actually be helpful in the future. \\n\\nI do not participate in pop culture, nor do I try to look fashionable, and I have a reputation for saying out-of-pocket shit a lot. If *I* can have a social life that satisfies me (though it admittedly wouldn’t satisfy a lot others), then so can you (:', 'You’re like exactly like me but a lot younger than you 😭😭 maybe try having one really close friend.

That kinda thing does depend on your location I suppose but if you're living in the western world, getting randomly kidnapped just being outside in a semi-public place is exceedingly rare.

They like me, I think. Putting myself out there seems like the hardest part, to whom? And how? Especially since my class is segregated by gender. I had a chat with a guy about super hero movies once because we got stuck during a rainy day so the few students that did arrive took classes together, we didn’t agree on much but atleast we had equal knowledge on said heroes (I don’t remember his face anymore and I never asked his name).

    36: "I’m a loser and I feel so lonely Well, I thought I’d vent a little since this is anonymous and basically no one will see this. I’m a sixteen year old girl, I’ve been introverted my whole life so I just never leave my house. I threw myself at difficult obsessions, art, hobbies, games, visual novels, YouTube rabbit holes. I have no social skills, no life skills. Due to me growing up with art/anime from a super young age, I ended up never fitting in, Japanese music has always been weird to people around me, the monotone YouTubers I watch are boring to others, I could not get into Bollywood, I didn’t know what they were talking about so I tried searching and studying but I only ever liked one or two popular movies which is fine for maybe one conversation but I can’t keep using the same topic again and again. It’s exhausting. Around two years ago, I was diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist, his exact words were that I had no light in my eyes. After thinking about it more, I realized I’ve always been this way, a recluse, a hermit without friends. I make online friends often but we usually drift apart. I changed schools five times at this point because we moved a lot, I never made lasting friendships at schools. Now I just stopped trying, I don’t try to make friends anymore, it’s exhausting knowing eventually I’ll lose them too. \nMost of the time, this loneliness isn’t so bad, I can take it but sometimes it just gets so overwhelming. I see all these people around me getting into relationships, telling me about them. I don’t want to hear it, I just end up with a reminder of how unlovable I feel because I’m cold and distant.\n\nI don’t think it’s due to my appearance, sure, I don’t make much effort other than washing my face with face wash but I look average. My skin texture is a little bad at my forehead but my fringe covers it anyways. \n\nIt’s no one’s fault really, I’m just a recluse so people just don’t know me or don’t remember me. I don’t know if I’m even coherent anymore but I guess i just wanted this off my chest. I feel awful. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/18v9jxj/im_a_loser_and_i_feel_so_lonely/",

I started hurting myself when I turned 7, there was no other way to cope. I tried everything. Books, meditation, psychotherapy, sports, video games, music, art, EVERYTHING. Nothing could help.  \n  \nThat's when I gave up. I was only 10 already and lost all hope. Nothing could distract me and nothing made me happy.  I made my first attempt at 12. Had to go to the psych ward after I failed. Didn't help, of course.  \n  \nI ran away from my parents at 13 and moved to a group home. Things only got worse. I got diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD, Asperger's and social anxiety. I'm going to multiple therapists, but none of them can really help. And to be honest, I don't even want help anymore. It's like I'm addicted to the pain. I can't be bothered to care about myself anymore.  \n  \nAll I want is to get drunk and high. Seriously, there's nothing else that even comes close to making me feel as good as drugs.  \n  \nFuck, I don't have the motivation to write anything else. I've poured my heart out on this damn site so many fucking times. Do any of you even care?\n  \n  \nI just wanna die man.

    44: "My room should be my private place, right? So I’ve moved into a new house with my mother and the walls are so damn thin she can hear practically everything I do or say if I don’t have headphones on or I’m whispering. I want my privacy, I want to say whatever I want without having to be scolded. \n\nAs many people do, I make occasionally offensive jokes from time to time with my friends. Nothing too serious, always poking fun at my friends and they do the same with me. I’ll make jokes about where they’re from, stuff I can remember about them, etcetera etcetera.\n\nThe problem is tho is that my mom is always listening. I could be sat in my room and making jokes with my friends but if I say the wrong thing a little too loud then I get scolded and threatened with taking my PlayStation away or my phone. The thing is tho I’ve got speculated autism  my friend with autism said I’ve most likely got it but I’ve never been confirmed so take it with a grain of salt . If I’m without my phone or PlayStation I’m without my music, I can’t survive without music. Music is something that’s so important to me that the main reason I always have my phone is to listen to music. Off topic but needed to show how important my stuff is to me.\n\nShe’s always listening in on what I’m saying, on what I’m doing, but she never just leaves me alone. I’d say I’m pretty self aware that since I’m a teenager I’m probably blowing this out of proportion but I don’t feel like I can talk at all how I want to with my friends when she’s around.\n\nLike today, I make a joke with some of my friends about how one of my Mexican friends probably hopped the border or built a house to come here. It’s all obviously fun and games between me and him but my mom comes stomping over and swings my door open. I always mute my mic before I talk to her so I just kinda looked at her, waiting for her to say something. She didn’t quite yell but said loudly that she’s tired of me making jokes like that and that she’s “about done with that game and that she’ll take it away if I say something like that again”.  \n\nI’ve always felt as if a kid’s room is somewhere I shouldn’t ever act like how they want to express themselves is bad bc it’s a safe haven to be themself. I could get it if I was saying the N word or something but I’m just poking fun at my friend. I laughed after saying it so it obviously was a joke. This type of stuff has happened before too so now I just feel like I shouldn’t even hop on my PlayStation just so I don’t get in trouble. I don’t wanna talk to her about stuff either bc it feels like she’s always listening anyway so I might as well just let her hear it to figure it out.\n\nAlso  I’m gonna start ranting about other things here, if u want to read u can but the top thing was the main problem , when I tried to say I didn’t like my bed frame bc it was too tall and I asked if I could just have my mattress on the floor, she said no. I’ve always felt like my room is my room, if I want to change it I should be able to. I hate this stupid bed frame anyway, it’s so big for no reason and I’ve always seen almost every bed frame as useless anyway. \n\nI love my mother bc ik how much she’s sacrificed for me and how much more she will but I just want to be left alone and decorate my room how I want. I’ve always felt like my feelings for how I want to do something have been ignored but that’s just parents in general ig. Also, my little comment on how important music was to me earlier will come in handy right now. I’m a sensitive person on some stuff, I’ll admit it. Music is one of them. If I get my phone taken or my PlayStation and I don’t have music, I’ll probably get kinda depressed.\n\nAlso, if she takes my phone or PlayStation, I can’t talk to my friends from my hometown or that are in different places where I can’t see them daily. I don’t wanna lose contact with them and feel like they feel like I’m ignoring them. She constantly threats every time I’m in trouble to take my phone or PlayStation. It makes me just not want to talk to her a lot of times and be alone. I hardly ever want to ask for stuff except food and simple requests bc Idk how she’ll react to me asking. \n\nThat’s it, yap done https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1f9ggaa/my_room_should_be_my_private_place_right/",

Like i never thought in 1,000 years that K would be a swiftie and have a Stanley life every single other girl but I do. Here is my defense:\n\nTaylor swifts music is HAPPY and makes me want to SING and DANCE. I used to listen to rap and sad music and it made me depressed asf and really affected my outlook on life. So therefore I am a swiftie.\n\nStanley cups are just all around useful. You can use the straw, turn the little thingy to use a sipping hole, or completely close off all the holes. It hold about 2 water bottles and fits in a cup holder.\n\nI realised that most teenage girls that are swifties and have Stanleys provably think the same was we do, but we just live in such a judgemental society that things like that are “basic” and are shunned upon. \n\nTL;DR—- We need to stop judging teenage girls for being “basic” when you would most likely do/have the same things if you were a female.  https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1diweac/is_anybody_else_females_turning_into_basic_white/",

    47: 'Whats the point anymore  sorry for the rant  Ok i know this post is long and also if you dont really care then please stop reading im not trying to get people like you to help.  If you want to know im 15 male  Also this is kind of split into sectioms where for a while i talk about parts of my life and i know i will sound winey but idc, if this helps me im doing it.\n\nSo i basically dont know what to do anymore, i feel like my life kinda sucks and ive made a few posts and then got a few helpful comments that did help me out. Now this did lead to me not needing to make any more posts here for about a month or so. However, my problems have well.. came back and gotten worse. Tho i do have 2 people that i would call friend now but as always they are not perfect and still not really "best" friend type people. Also one of my previous friends have just slipped into a sort of idk like guy ig since hes been influenced by the other people my friends hang around which sucks because i thought he might be a best friend within the future . Then when my 2 friends are around the others they become slightly like them and then everyone starts basically bullying each other over small things like miss pronouncing a word or saying something that is classed as \'stupid\' when it a hypothetical situation or just a thought. Thats mainly what i hate about them and how they are just so toxic and goes off as banter when its really not, its straight up bullying. I have tried to find new friends online in games such as vrchat but no luck at all since i spent 2 hours and i didnt talk to anyone since i was too scared  yes, also comes up later . Overall i get really nervous with new people and just cant start a conversation with anyone for the life of me but yeah thats pretty much it about my friends. Soooo still no luck with girlfriends but i did try with one person which i tried to talk to them and then they looked interested but then after i got like 2 sentences in they probably realised i was just some loser who got nervous around women.. so yeah.. which i was very much and felt my self stuttering almost every word. Then i had one of those times  i think everone does this.. right?  where you listen to music thats usually sad or slowed and had the thought of if i cant even talk to women then how tf am i getting a girlfriend let alone keeping one.. its just huh? Same with friends how i cant talk to anyone new sooo whats the point anymore..  title, idk just pointed it out  i feel like i can never really get a girlfriend or a new friend ever. Like ever. One thing thanks to those people who said how to talk to women tho it didnt really work because i tried to seem confident, but you just read how that worked out. Now for my mental state.. its not good like at all. And i have almost cried like 10 times just reflecting on everything. Posting on reddit just feels like some sort of therapy for me ig.. because sometimes it actually helps so thank you. Overall tho i feel mainly depressed like actually tho you get sometimes where im not thinking about negative thoughts and genuinely feel happy. I have researched on how to maybe help with this and luckily i havnt had any suicidal thoughts or anything.. yet. But i have been working out like 2 hours a week and its not really helping i do feel proud of myself but i just want to feel attention or affection at the end of the day. Not having working out as my top priority rn. Also yes i briefly mentioned how i want to be a victim in i think my first post idk to sum this up i feel like they might be understanding and not feel awkward about my nervousness and therefore i would be able to talk to them and they might pity me.. but also this isnt good ik because obvious reasons.. and dont even get me started on addictions. but yeah thats pretty much all. \n\nSo to some a bit up i just need advice to help me.. like how do i overcome nervousness? And my friends suck and i aint getting a girlfriend i dont think ever  not because i dont want to but because i cant  also i mentally not ok and need help with fixing it ty for reading this  if you did  already a weight is off my chest just typing this i think thats all will be looking at like every comment because it will help. Even if you just say "you got this" still will make me smile : \n\nOne morree thing i need to know if everyone else has felt like this before at somepoint just so you can tell me how you fixed these problems or atleast some of them. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1f2sw2i/whats_the_point_anymore_sorry_for_the_rant/',

    52: "Kinda want to end it all Basically what the title says...\n\nI've been experiencing alot of depression at night and it effects the way my day goes in the morning for school. I'm 17 btw. My usual schedule is to wake up at like 6am for school get ready and then get home, I sometimes have work  I only work 15-20h a week  and I go to that until 6 or 8 and then I watch a stream or play video games for a few hours. At about 10pm or later I start to get depressed for no reason, like I swear it's a switch. Some days it doesn't happen others it does, I somtimes have streaks of it. \n\nI don't have a bad living situation really, my family isn't bad or abusive other than man dad started doing some vices which kinda hurt me because he is a big role model in my life.  My mom is out of the picture .\n\nI have anxiety at school and have a few friends that just Bully me idk if they are even friends or bullies, the line is so blurred because I haven't had actual friends since I moved from my town.\n\nIk lots of people say to try to distract yourself from the depression with like music or streams or video games or an activities but it just doesn't work for me, it honestly makes it worse. I've resorted to just going to bed instead of feeling terrible. But somtimes when I'm depressed at night I can't fall asleep and my thoughts just race in my head about how useless I really am to the people around me and that if i wasn't here on earth it wouldn't chnage or be easier for others. \n\nIk this isn't a good state of mind and I'm aware but I just honestly give up. Last week I was fine and then this week depression has hit me like a truck. I just don't understand....\n\nI've started to think maybe I could try self harm as a option to maybe prevent myself from feeling like this.

    54: "Serious Vent  Long post  TW: abuse/drugs/sh/violence/other stuff\n\nOkay, so, I have NO idea what to do about this... I am not sure where else to go, or who else to tell. I have tried texting hotlines multiple times for advice but they either ended the text or my messages didn't go through. I am SO sick of this and I feel VERY stupid because I have zero knowledge on legal things and I am slow as heck when catching up to anything.\n\nThis is important for context. I don't remember anything at all except big events that happened before this summer break. I guess my brain blocked out all the trauma or I didn't realize it was happening  maybe both . I grew up with my biological mom and two half siblings. My mom did a lot of drugs and went through physical abuse in relationships and whatnot. Eventually she got arrested and I was in fostercare with someone who knew her through my sister because my brothers would pass through foster care too sometimes  I don't know how this works . Anyway, we got seperated and I got adopted by her  foster mom  blah blah blah.\n\nFast forward, I am here alone in this house with her. She divorced foster dad for abuse, and her sons live elsewhere. My non-biological mom  from now on referred to as \"mom\"  is literally the worst person I know.\n\nI am not sure if this is my fault. Maybe I'm just too lazy, uncaring, and apathetic... But she is always mad over every teeny tiny little thing. One time I accidentally locked the doorknob to the back door, and she was SO mad. She's never told me I can't lock it before. Maybe my memory is crap. Either way, it's just a door. A lock. To protect our house... I know she takes a lot of meds. Sometimes she is in an angry state and brings back irrelevant issues from years or weeks ago out of the blue, then grills me on it for HOURS. In the past she has kept me from sleeping like, \"Oh, you can go to bed now little princess\"  sarcastic tone  but then comes back less than five minutes later saying more crap to me.\n\nWhen she's mad I usually go outside, sit behind the car, and draw or read. She wouldn't let me do it at first. Now she threatens to call the cops but I go outside anyway because I need some frickin SPACE. I am literally still on our own property. I used to only be allowed to go in the backyard, never the front, while she was mad. She said it's because she said so. Then she wouldn't let me walk the dog because she thinks I am going to hurt her  Dog is an Akita, very large and strong, for context . That's insane. I LOVE animals. She put the two cats in her room one night and shut the door because she thought I would let them out to prove a point... I know damn well she doesn't care THAT much because one time she threw a spoon with melted chocolate or Nutella and called the dog over, asking if I want to kill the dog. Thankfully, the dog didn't eat any of it. Speaking of throwing stuff, there are MULTIPLE holes and dents in the walls. She also took a basket of my drawing supplies to Goodwill because I didn't clean my room the SECOND she told me to, and there was a Deadpool comic book we bought in there, and probably other stuff not art related. Now it's gone. I LOVED that comic book. And no I can't just get another one. I am not able to spend my money. Actually, hell, I am pretty sure she moved my wallet thing and now I can't find it and she DOESN'T know where it IS. I am BROKE. I want a job but she says she is not driving me. That I have to drive myself. I am 16, just started learning how to drive. I don't even want to drive places; I hate driving. I want to walk. I want to explore nature.\n\nUnrelated to whatever I was just yapping about, I can't use any electronics without asking. I am allowed one hour online, thirty minutes doing something like a chore or whatever, then another hour online. That's fine, but if she is mad she takes and hides my electronics in her room then forgets where she hid them. Then, when I start looking after she says I can play the next day, she gets offended saying there's no reason to find them. The VR is expensive. I am NOT letting her lose it because I paid for HALF of it. She also broke my old phone, my Android I basically worshipped for the APK file ability and easy peasy navigation. She threw it at the wall, causing me to utter the first curse word ever heard by a human from my mouth. It broke, the back falling off, the screen wrecked. She broke it because I was calling my brother for HELP while she was mad.\n\nMy mom constantly calls me sarcastic names like \"princess\", \"sweet pea\", and things like that, y'known, the whole southern kabang. Sometimes she non-sarcastically calls me things too, like a jerk, or compares me to my biological mom. She calls me disrespectful, once she called me \"monster\" and \"evil\". She makes sarcastic remarks like, \"let me do such-and-such for you my poor baby, if you're going to act like a two-year-old I will treat you like one,\" and \"let me do everrryyyything for you, because poor little \\ deadname\\  can't do anything herself.\"\n\nShe is always mocking and inaccuratly imitating me. If I cry, she asks, \"why are you crying? hmph, I should be the one crying! Stop trying to make me feel sorry for you with this fake rountine you have down to an artform\" and she will exaggerate fake crying, imitating me. \n\nOf course I have told her it makes me uncomfortable. But her excuse is like, \"you call me names too\"  i don't  or \"what names have i called you\" which is humiliating to repeat them, since they already bring me pain hearing them as a trans boy. \n\nSpeaking of transgenderness, I asked her if I could use her computer for research, because I was writing an informational essay I wanted to present to her, for fun. She asked what it was about and I said it was about myself. She got confused about why I was researching things and got mad when I said I would tell her when she reads it. She asked when I would read it, I said Wednesday, because that's when my friend comes to my house after school. I was planning on reading it to them, and have my friend around so I would feel safe and have support. Well, that set her OFF. She said she has a degree in psychology and knows all about LGBTQ and doesn't need a LECTURE from some kids. She demanded me to read it the next day. We sat in the kitchen and I had five pages handwritten. I was forced to read it all, without support from my friend, and immediately felt unsafe. I explained  don't laugh  the real meaning of a furry to her, because she had misinformed views. I had statics I pulled from multiple sites, I had quotes, evidence, the whole shebang. My English teacher would've been proud. Additionally, I wrote about my LGBTQ identity, that I feel like a boy and I want to be called he/him, but at that point my mom entered mad mode and everything I said was going in one ear, out the other. She said I am concerning, confused, and getting a therapist. She took my papers and did who-knows-what with them. They are probably in her room right now. Luckily I skipped reading the page about alterhumanity, and totally ripped up the pages on atheistic Satanism beforehand  if you don't know what that is, there's an AMA on my account with an explanation . She said I am more NON-BINARY than anything. This is after multiple times in the past she has literally said, \"well I think YOU think you know you are a girl.\" Okay first of all, \"I think you think\" is dumb ASF. She has NO CLUE how or what I think about. She even said, \"well you never mentioned it before, so your friend must have influenced you. She is degrading you, trying to clone all of you into a little army. She wants you all to look and act like she wants. Ever noticed all her friends have short hair? Now she is gaslighting you into it too. You've literally never mentioned any of this before. \" What the actual fck. OF COURSE I have never mentioned it. I was trans in denial for so long because I was misinformed by HER and didn't know it was possible to be comfortable in my own skin. Now she's saying things like, \"if you cut your hair you will hate it\" and \"boys can have pretty long hair too\" and she NEVER uses my pronouns. I texted my friend this and they were so upset. They never comes to my house because they HATE my mom. I texted my biological mom about it, and she said she loves me no matter what, and offered to text my half siblinga about it so I didn't have to. They don't understand. My brothers laughed about it and said it was sad and made a joke about not being surprised if someone they knew suddenly came out as gay. My sister just asked if she got permission to tell them. Later she texted me saying she supports me. Every now and them my bio mom asks how the identity stuff is going, and I even told her about alterhumanity. She doesn't know how to use my pronouns,  \"guys your little sister is now your little brother, she- I mean he said that she- I mean he, look I am going to call her she with you guys and he around her\" my mom wasn't trying to be rude, but that defeats the purpose of pronouns... it was funny!  \n\nAnyway, I am basically not allowed to cut my hair. Mom calls me girl and stuff. She insults me and uses my deadname. I am actually glad she doesn't use my name or pronouns, that would be giving her ammunition. The waiting time for a therapist, which I did want, was a couple months. It has been more than a couple and I still haven't got one.\n\nLet me state first, SOMEHOW I am NOT depressed and I looooove life! Genuinely, I love being alive so much, I am almost always happy  that is, when my mom is not a jerk . After seven months of cutting, she found out. I never really made an attempt to hide it, hell, I would cut while in class. Anyway, she took my X-acto knife. I had extra blades in the bathroom but decided to just give those to her too. She actually cared and stuff, so while she was crying over my messed up arm, I was smiling and trying not to laugh because I was happy she cared. It didn't take long for that to become ammunition too. She mocked my self-harm when she was mad. \"Now you're just like all the other kids. You are like those kids you hate\"  in which the song, \"Becoming What I Hate\" by Archetypes Collide came into my head  \"Now you are emo.\" like WOW. Okay. She said I was doing it for attention. So, like the dumbass I am I started searching up pictures of sh and I read something about another unexpected tool to use... yeah uhm... light bulb. A couple months later she found those too and didn't cry this time. Now I have no blades  you may cheer, I guess  but now I have nothing to take my stress out on. I bang my head against the wall or use my nails.\n\nAnywho, as you can see I am under a lot of pressure. I feel like I am stupid. Her sons went to Georgia Tech and make loads of money because they are sooo smart. But me? I can't remember what I ate yesterday. I don't know what I was doing an hour ago. If something is not told in story form, I will never remember. My mom expects me to get perfect grades too. She says she will settle for B's but that I should get A's and that I am \"playing dumb\" to get out of putting in effort.\n\nI feel like I am the best, nicest person ever. I am proud of how I help people, strive educate them, and spread positivity. Proud of myself. I feel like a good person. But then my mom comes and stomps all over my bright and peachy day. She calls me names, asks why I can't do anything right. Expects me to do everything for her. \"You never offer to cook meals. When IIII was little, I made meals for my family\" and just keeps comparing me to her, or me to her sons, or me to my bio mom. \"If you run away, who are you going to go to? Mama  bio  will just use you, she can't even take care of herself.\" and I used to not care. I used to hate my bio mom. But we have met up a couple times  with mom too  and Mama is doing SO much better. She quit big drugs, but vapes sometimes. She has a job and a car now. She has offered to pay for things at meetups like Fair entry tickets, food, movie tickets. She is repairing her life. She is trying to be my Mama again... I just want a mom, man...\n\ni was so fucking happy this morning. i was on Reddit spreading it to everyone, complimenting, giving friendly advice, spreading positive messages and encouragement. then my mom caught me on VR which is like, yeah ok i wasnt supposed to be on.\n\n but then she got mad because she said i was making too much noise when she said she was going to sleep in and then got mad bc i didnt offer to make her breakfast after she had a long day yesterday. firstly, i have to eat too. im not waiting hours to use the goddamn air-fryer and there wasnt any other food. second, I WAS LITERALLY MAKING HER BREAKFAST. and she didnt even want breakfast because i asked if she wanted any of what i made and she said no  it was hashbrown patties . then she got mad i didnt do the dishes even though the dishes are loud asf and i just ran them because i didnt want her to be mad if i forget to do the dishes because shes literally stopping me from doing my chores since theyre all loud. then her medicine is on the front porch anr she demands to know when it arrived when i didnt even KNOW IT WAS THERE. my day is utterly ruined. \n\ni came to walk the dog and she said i better not be standing around messing w my music. I DONT STAND AROUND. the dog sometimes doesnt want to walk so i have to practically drag her. and i DONT constantley adjust my music. she also thinks i only walk to be on my phone and thats not true either i just want to listen to music. now shes always checking on me to make sure im actually walking. \n\ni was using the bathroom yesterday and she stood outside the door asking what i was doing and thought i was LYING. she thought i was cutting but she already took all my blades and i just wanted to use the fucking bathroom. IM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO LOCK ANY DOORS. Im always scared shes gonna burst through the bathroom door while im using it or my bedroom while im getting dressed.  I DONT HAVE ANY GODDAMN PRIVACY. this was before she even knew i cut. she would accuse me of having a second cell phone i bought from a kid at school. I DONT TALK TO KIDS AT SCHOOL. I DONT HAVE FRIENDS. My day was SO good but she fucking ruined it like always. \n\nI am so SICK of this. I tell her to leave me alone. Go away. I want to be alone right now. She doesn't listen. She was in my room and I was SO pissed because she was messing with my room again and she stepped all over my art, crinkling it. I lost it, I pushed her, and she knocked over my ceramic piggy bank by accident. She later said I threw it at her. She had a piece, a shard, stuck in her hand... I said I never threw it but she didn't care. Then she bled on my art and I screamed the second cuss word ever heard from my mouth by a human being. She knew she was bleeding and went over to step on my art AGAIN and BLEED on it. I pushed her again. Look, should I have pushed her? NO. Violence is NOT the answer. But my mind was exploding. I rapidly sorted my art into piles and kept throwing all the 'bad' ones away. I was going CRAZY.  She kept stepping on it because I was near my bedroom door and she sat on my bed, refusing to leave my room because she thought I wouldn't clean it otherwise, and so she was trying to get past me forcefully, even though I was starting to move it out of her way or she could have EASILY stepped over it all. \n\nThat was actually the third time I had to resort to violence. The first was because she was trying to throw away my favorite band sweatshirt, a gift from my bio Mama. I loved that band and that sweatshirt. I cornered her in the hallway to the garage. There's a very big trash can there, and I can't get it back out of the trash can because I can't tip it over due to trash being in it, and I can't reach in because I have short arms and I am 4\"11 at 90 pounds.  I wouldn't have been able to get it back. So I used my body to block her and hold her so I could get my sweatshirt back. \n\nThe other time I resorted to violence, again, she was messing with my art stuff and I lost my mind, scratching and pushing her.\n\nLook, I know it wasn't right... I just don't know what to do. I threatened to run away once, even made a list of what I need and a plan, but she said \"you don't do anything around here, you are disrespectful!\" as if that is supposed to make me want to STAY?? \n\nI am not sure what other big events have happened, I am probably forgetting stuff...\n\nGuys, is it my fault? Am I a bad person, classic teen, yapping about stuff that is not important? I really need help, I don't want to hurt anyone... I need advice. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ec13v7/serious_vent_long_post/",

    60: 'I‘m bored so here you have the wikipedia article of popular german television character „Bernd das Brot“ Bernd das Brot  English: Bernd the bread loaf  is a puppet character, star mascot, and pop cultural icon of the German children\'s television channel KiKA, 1  2  3  currently featured in the programs Bernd das Brot, Bravo Bernd, and the KiKA late night loop programme. 4  He is primarily characterised by his chronic depression. 1  3  5 \n\nBernd das Brot puppet and puppeteer Jörg Teichgraeber  de  during an autograph session\nBernd debuted on KiKA in 2000. He became a household name among adult television viewers in 2003 when his broadcasts were played on loop during the hours of 9PM to 6AM, a time during which no regular programming airs.\nRole on KiKA\nedit\nBernd is a depressed and curmudgeonly 3  pullman loaf, speaking in a deep, gloomy baritone. 1  He is small, rectangular and golden brown 3  with hands directly attached to his body, 5  rings around his eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. 6  According to himself, he belongs to the species homo brotus depressivus. 5  His favourite activities include staring at the south wall of his home, 3  memorising the pattern of his woodchip wallpaper, reading his favourite magazine The Desert and You, expanding his video collection of the most boring railway tracks, and eating lukewarm gruel. Bernd sympathizes firstly with himself, 4  and is bad-tempered 7  and fatalistic. 8 \nHis favorite expression is Mist!, used in much the same way as the English "crap". 8  6  His other catchphrases are: "I would like to be left alone," "I would like to leave this show," and "My life is hell." 1  6 \nAccording to his in-universe backstory, the short-armed bread character made his first appearance as part of an advertising campaign for a bakery chain. When the campaign turned out unsuccessful, Bernd was forced to apply for job at the KiKA  more specifically, the MDR member of the ARD  which is also the reason for his permanent scowl. Bernd himself does not want to appear on television and thinks it is a "dirty business". 3 \nThe reason for Bernd\'s depression was revealed in the 85th episode of the series. In his telling: " ...  A long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so unbelievably charming and funny. But unfortunately my affection was in vain. She only had eyes for this perfect stranger, a multigrain bread. It was so devastating.  ...  My heart has been a dry clump of flour ever since."\nBernd interacts with two co-main characters. One is the chatty Chili das Schaf  "Chili the sheep" 9  , 3  a female, yellow sheep with flaming red hair. Chili, the show\'s Gastgeberin  hostess , is a Stuntschaf  stunt sheep  who finds it exciting to have close calls with accidents. 6  The other main character is the show\'s technical expert, the always pleasant Briegel der Busch  Briegel the Bush , 3  a green, bespectacled bush with flowers and leaves in lieu of hair. Briegel is an inventor who loves to build complicated devices that almost inevitably explode of their own accord - these devices are usually what is sold on the show. 6  In contrast to Bernd, they enjoy adventures and the excitement of life. 1  Bernd doesn\'t hide that he doesn\'t think very highly of his colleagues, refusing to call them by name  instead calling them "Bush" and "Sheep" respectively  while they treat him as their best friend, even give him nicknames such as "Berndi".\nThe first show starring Bernd, Chili, and Briegel was the 2001 pastiche Tolle Sachen, die einzige Werbesendung auf KiKA  English: Great things, the only advertising show on KiKA   KiKA is actually a public, commercial-free channel . 6  In this show Chili and Briegel would advertise an object that would be tested by a "randomly" chosen tester that would invariably turn out to be Bernd. Shows with Bernd, Chili and Briegel also include pastiches of Robin Hood, Star Trek, Western and fairy tales. 6 \nProduction\nedit\n\nKrappweis  left  demonstrates the resemblance between Bernd das Brot and his colleague Norman Cöster  right \nBernd was created in 2000 by Norman Cöster and Tommy Krappweis, of the production company Bumm Film in Munich, Bavaria. 4  KiKA had asked several entertainment companies to create a new sheep mascot, including The Jim Henson Company. 4  Krappweis and Cöster were dining in a pizzeria one night and scribbled sketches on a napkin while watching a bread basket.  4  Cöster said "Bread is funny". Krappweis obtained a square-shaped loaf of bread to which he then gave the face of his colleague Norman Cöster, who also shares many personality traits with Bernd. 4  Upon that idea, Bernd and later on the other figures were developed  10   11 \nSimilarly, Krappweis himself served as archetype for Chili the Sheep, who - just like Krappweis himself in his earlier years - gets on people\'s nerves with nonsensical stunts, while Briegel the Bush was modeled after a further producer of the series, Michael Briegel. He, too, is said to have a predisposition for wreaking havoc - according to an anecdote, he once set fire to an office computer.\nThe completed character designs of Bernd and Briegel are the work of cartoonist Georg Graf von Westphalen. Bernd is played and voiced by puppeteer Jörg Teichgraeber.\nReception\nedit\nAlthough Bernd was created in 2000, and has been on television since 2001, 6  he first rose to fame in 2003. 7  5  Until then, KiKA was sharing its satellite channel frequency with the Franco-German channel Arte, but after 2003, KiKA got the frequency for itself. As a children\'s channel, KiKA did not air programs between 9pm and 6am, but instead of putting a simple test card, programmers decided to air a late night loop program starring Bernd every night. 7  5  6  In the 2005 version of the program, Bernd constantly stated that he had had enough of television and was going home and advised the viewers to do likewise. 1  The night loop program continues to this day. 4  This program allowed late-night adult viewers to discover Bernd; those viewers would then discuss the bread loaf on Internet forums, buy Bernd-das-Brot merchandising and CDs although none of them were advertised, and participate in Bernd-themed KiKA competitions alongside children. 6  How many adult viewers watch Bernd remains unknown, because KiKA is a children\'s channel whose programs officially end at 9pm and thus no audience measurement is made for KiKA during the night, at the time the Bernd night loop program airs. Furthermore, KiKA\'s main audience being children, adults are not counted even in audience measurements performed during official airing times. 6 \nBernd has thousands of child and adult fans in Germany 3  and is greatly popular. 1  12  Jeremy Wasser of Spiegel Online wrote that "Bernd epitomized the fundamental pessimism felt by many, if not most, Germans about, well, almost everything.  ...  That Germans would take to a character like Bernd and be willing to engage in this form of self-analysis and self-mockery should, in my view, be commended. That the people of the land of Goethe and Schiller would choose as their guide in this spiritual exploration a clinically depressed loaf of bread, is, perhaps, just another improbable element of the German Zeitgeist". 1  David Frogier de Ponlevoy, also of Spiegel Online, commented that Bernd shows were "a successful mix of slapstick and irony that irresistibly brings families in good mood." 6  The Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the idea of making a depressed loaf of bread the star of a children\'s channel was crazily funny. 4 \nIn 2004, Bernd das Brot won the Adolf Grimme Award 3  for representing "the right to bad mood" and resisting "the reign of good mood that endlessly drones out of the television". 7  5  The Deutsche Welle commented that "most likely the jury realized just how subversive Bernd das Brot\'s attitude is when many human beings these days are willing to do almost anything to achieve fame and fortune on TV". 3  The Adolf Grimme Award is the German equivalent of the Emmy Award. 3 \nKidnapping\nedit\n\nStatue of Bernd das Brot back in front of the town hall in Erfurt, Germany after its kidnapping\nIn fall 2007, 7  KiKA donated a statue of Bernd to the German city of Erfurt, Thuringia, 12  where KiKA is based, 8  to celebrate the channel\'s tenth anniversary. 5  The statue is 2 metres  6 ft 7 in  high, 7  weighs 125 kilograms  276 lb  5  and is made of plastic. 4  It stands on the Fischmarkt  English: Fish market , the city\'s main square, next to the neo-gothic town hall 8  12  and is a tourist attraction. 5  On 21 January 2009, the figure disappeared. 12  13  It was next seen in a video released on YouTube, in which a group of activists 7  calling themselves "Team 129 A" 8  claimed responsibility for its kidnapping. 8  12  Bernd expressed solidarity with the activists in the video, prompting several media to joke that he had developed Stockholm syndrome. 8  12 \nThe activists were squatting in the abandoned Topf and Sons factory, where ovens and gas chamber ventilation systems for the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp were manufactured. 14  The occupation was to prevent the city of Erfurt from redeveloping the area into apartments and office space. 2  8  They opened a literary cafe and were giving lecture events. 12  The negotiations broke down when the activists rejected an offer for alternative housing. 2  8  The squatters themselves denied involvement in Bernd\'s kidnapping, claiming a group of sympathizers might be responsible for it. 2  7 \nThe public broadcaster Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, which owns the rights to Bernd das Brot, quickly forced YouTube to remove the video from the site 8  by having their lawyers claim copyright infringements. 5  Steffen Kottkamp, head of KiKA, strongly criticized Bernd\'s kidnapping. 8  Krappweis called for the figure\'s return, stating that "Kidnapping, even of bread loaves, is the wrong means of achieving political goals". 12  Fans set up an online petition calling for the return of the statue in Erfurt. 5 \nThe Bernd figure was eventually found intact by chance on 1 February 2009 in the basement vault of a disused barracks in Nohra, between Erfurt and Weimar. 7  According to Spiegel Online, five children had been searching the area to collect period artifacts before it was demolished. They then discovered the Bernd statue and alerted KiKA and the police. How the statue ended up there is unknown. 5  After forensics experts confirmed that it was the genuine statue, it was carried out of the basement by six police officers 7  5  13  and ultimately brought back to its original location on the Fischmarkt in front of Erfurt\'s town hall.\nWorks\nedit\nMusic\nedit\nChart placements\nSingles 15 \n"Tanzt das Brot"\n \tGER\t41\t22 September 2003\t 18 weeks \t\n"Bernds Balkon"\n \tGER\t88\t9 August 2004\t 2 weeks \t\n2003: Tanzt das Brot  Single \n2003: Rockt das Brot  Album \nChili-TV-Rap / Ich habe ein kleines Cha Cha Cha / Ich sage NEIN / Zu spät / Bluesbrot Bernd / Briegel, komm / Ich will wieder heim / Tanzt das Brot / Saulaut  gesungen von Chili dem Schaf  / Bielefeld / Easy Briegel / Schreit das Schaf  gesungen von Chili dem Schaf  / Buschig, brotig, chilischarf / Geht einfach alle weg / Dubididum\n2004: Bernds Balkon  Single \nExklusives on Sampler:\n2001: Was geht ab?  on the Sampler KiKA-Hits \n2007: Tanzt das Brot  Party-Mix 2007   on the Sampler KiKA Hits – Das Beste aus den ersten 10 Jahren \n2007: P… wie Party  on the Sampler KiKA Geburtstagsparty \n2008: Fußball Fußball Hey Hey Hey  on the Sampler KiKA Fußball-Hits \nVideo games\nedit\nKikania  2001, Ubisoft \nBernd das Brot und die Unmöglichen  2013, Deep Silver \n\n\nReferences\nExternal links https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1f5wq33/im_bored_so_here_you_have_the_wikipedia_article/',
    61: "Ask away  https://i.redd.it/nhrb8ue7wgqa1.jpg",
    62: "Am I faking all of this ? Long story short :\n\nRecently I have been feeling a bit depressed but I think that I'm faking it.. I have reasons for both which I will show here. \n\nThis whole thing has kinda ruined my life for a bit cuz I'm usually the \"funny guy\" people don't expect sth like this out of me. I'm always sitting somewhere thinking about it , never comming up with an answer , I genuinely don't know what to do \n\n\nWhy I thought i was depressed \n\nLoneliness : even tho I'm good with everyone I don't actually have any real friends , people that look forward or want to see me . My \"best friend\" while a great person , doesn't rlly care abt me . he mostly hangs out with other people with me feeling like a last resort. Don't get any wrong ideas here , I'm glad he has other friends , great for him . It's just that it makes me feel like there's a problem with me \n\nAnother problem is that this is the third time I've moved schools , with most of the people here having came from last Yr . They already have their own friend groups , I never had the opportunity to fit in or find new friends bc they were already busy with their own friends.. and you want to know the funny part? \n\nI LIKE BEING LONELY , i genuinely cheer whenever I get to be alone , I love having time to myself , but when that is basically my whole life I just don't know how describe it but it's not nice . And again , I can't talk abt this with anybody cuz they'll feel like I'm joking or they just wouldn't care at all\n\nTerrible grades : last Yr I was up there with the top 5 best students but this year i was absolutely dogshit , like im still putting in all these hours studying but it feels like they have no payoff and im just wasting my time ?!! I wasnt even along side the worst. I was just stuck in below average which was even worse imo , yknow how they say \"third place is the best of the worst\" ? Well I was in second place   sort of   \"second place is the *worst* of the best\" and I felt so bad for it..\n\nFortunately it got a bit better with my finals but still , for the entirety of fall , every day was just : more studying _ no time for myself _ same bad grades , repeat\n\n\nWay too much thinking : I feel like I am genuinely unable to be normal , in every single conversation my minds just bouncing around everywhere not letting me focus . I'm always thinking of something , it could be sth serious like my future etc but it can also be : \"the way you walked there looked way too weird\" . It feels like I'm always being judged by someone for every single action , it makes it where I can feel imence guilt over the smallest inconveniences ever . It has made sleeping so much harder cuz my brains just dumping down all of these problems up my throat \n\n I swear to god my brain feels like it's in some sort of civil war with itself , one time I just randomly thought of blinking which made my brain just dip for some reason and then for the next 30 minutes I had to manually blink myself . Fortunately this wasn't the first time sth like this had happened so I knew how to fix it.. I tried to focus and listen to some music but then my brain would imidietly be like : \"\"you are now currently trying to ignore your blinking\"\" . This literally lead to me needing to manually blink for the next few hours or so ?!! \n\nThese things   plus some more minor ones   are why I think I was depressed lately...\n\nBut now for why I think I'm faking it \n\n\nWhy I think faking it \n\nTrauma : actually sitting and thinking abt it , I have never rlly experienced anything traumatic ? Sure my parents did nearly get a divorce when I was a kid but still.. , compared to actually depressed people ? Just a short scroll through this sub and you'll see people who've experienced way more Terrible stuff , one guy  18  had just seen her gf commit s#icide and was completely alone for his 19th bday party ?!! I was genuinely so embarrassed after reading that post.. I just imidietly thought : if this whole depression thing is real in the first place , then I must be one soft ass bitch\n\nLike seriously , how would you recover from that ? I genuinely feel ashamed to compare myself with them.... why would I ever become depressed , just bc I don't have any friends ?\n\nAttention bait : sometimes I feel like I'm doing all of this for attention , just a desperate fake play for my own selfish gain , isn't this post technically the same ? Aren't I just asking for validation ? Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing this for the answers and I'm only doing it to see WHY i should feel this way ... i could go on , on why i feel this way but i think you get the point .\n\nAnd at last , doing it bc its what would makes sense : this is by far the weirdest argument that my brain has come up with but I'd thought i could still share it here . Recently I have been watching aton of \"sad\" shows with other depressed characters that ppl might relate to and yeah I def relate to most of them , the problem is that I feel like my brain was just like \" well these are supposed to be relatable characters , so why wouldn't you relate to them more \" which made me unnaturally feel more depressed \n\nYknow at this point I'm just rambling on and wasting your time , I would absolutely appreciate any sort of advice or help cuz this whole thing has been puzzling me for atleast a month.... https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1dguwe1/am_i_faking_all_of_this/",

SHE ENJOYED IT! For god sakes she asked for my number after. I was amazed and in awe, a girl asked for MY NUMBER!! \n\nLike three months later I transferred to her school, that's when I found out, she had a boyfriend. This was on my first day and I almost had a break down, didn't though cause I'm a MAN!! 💪💪💪 After 3 days, me and him, began to become friends. This is not ideal  kinda forced to be friends he's kinda an asshole . But like a week after Valentine's Day, they broke up. He wanted me to take his side but I just stayed neutral and let it play out but I did support his depression until he started dating a new girl. That's when I fully realized that he was an ass, he told me when they started dating that he is mainly focused on her body, specifically her chest, he said some of these about the girl I liked when they were dating but I just let them slide. Any way me and her  not the new girl were done with her  are in art class, she introduced me to 'avatar the last airbender' while drawing toph for a project. I loved the show and we had one more thing to connect over. \n\nWhile ago, she invited me to go on her boat with her, her dad, two sisters, and her older sister's boyfriend  we know each others but that's not important he's graduated . So, we just went on this boat, broke down, went back to shore and swam for a while, and got Dairy Queen after. We rode home and listened to music, that was that, last time I saw her. That was a month ago. We've had only a few conversations since but she has said more than once at different times we should do it again and that she had a good time.\n\nThis girl is super funny and we just send memes back in forth sometimes, adding on that, she's cute. She has amazing hair and a gorgeous face and I look like a gremlin.\n\nThe big thing, think I'm just a friend that she enjoys being around or is it possible I'm thought of as more.  https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ex8xhh/guys_i_need_advice/",

Grades count more in highschool\n\nwhen my parents did the dance with no pants they gave me the worst genes of all time so now im blessed with depression, anxiety, ocd, adhd, and executive functioning disorder  all diagnosed . i barely survived 8th grade and i believe im failing one or two classes because of not turning in multiple assignments and overall lack of motivation. so imagine my shock when i realize my grades are gonna be pretty shitty, and then even shittier after taking the highschool exams, and then realizing its all going to be documented for colleges. i dont care about grades i just want a good job so i can make money. \n\n2. getting my ass jumped\ni might transfer to a really huge ass public school where kids sell drugs and beat each other up 24/7. normally, i wouldnt give a shit,  but i have a loud ass mouth and im probably gonna piss someone off and get beaten up im like 115lbs and scrawny as fuck, im going to die if even one punch is landed on me - i also cant fight for shit . im not really concerned about the beating up and getting injured as much as looking like an idiot. im also not pretty enough to have some sort of good social status. \n\n3. opps\n\nWARNING: I AM NOT TRYING TO SOUND LIKE AN "IM NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS🥺🥰" GIRL. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT BUT IM REALLY NOT. \n\ni am NOT anywhere near what type of girl is popular and considered cool. I think stanley cups are ugly, i hate lululemon, i hate taylor swift, i dont care for starbucks, i have a messy wolfcut type of hairstyle thats dirty dirty blonde/brunette and not long blonde straight hair or a high messy bun, my mascara is never clumpy like other girls have theirs  and they like it clumpy, which is embarrassing to me , i dont use sol de janeiro, i dont use claw clips, i hate the "preppy aesthetic", i hate scrunchies  they look like buttholes/vaginas , i hate neon pink/purple nirvana sweaters  i would def use it to wipe my ass tho , and my music taste is rock, grunge, and some pop  how do mfs hate rock music??? kiss, van halen, etc on TOP.  \n\nalso, a lot of people think im transgender MTF  i dont think being transgender is a bad thing btw  because i dont act like a girl  i have middle school boy humor, i act like an old white dad obsessed with rock music and making problematic jokes, i never dress in the "clean girl aesthetic", my eyeshadow is always wacky and intense, and all the stuff i listed above . \nHow does this make me transgender? no idea \nJust for you to get a clear image on my personality, i act exactly like dr gregory house  house md  and courtney love.

    67: "to anyone who'd wanna listen to my story to anyone who's reading this, this a good story, a couple of things i learnt about life, friendships, relationships, this isn't a sad story, it's just that i've got no one to tell it to, i just wanna share things that life will throw probably at anyone, and there'd be times when you'll be alone, but there's always gonna be someone who's gonna dive in in that pool of shit to help you out, to not let you drown and someone who'll always have your back.\n\nthis is one hell of a story, but i've got no one to tell it to, or no one that'd understand why or what led me to eff up bigtime on my friends, my love life, my parents, my grades  i've got prolly like 5 months before i take the JEE, the engineering entrance test in India .  all names are changed btw \n\ni'm not gonna say don't judge me or anything, i damn well want y'all's opinion on my story, i'm not ashamed to accept how much of a jerk, an idiot, or how big of a red flag i was, or how pathetic i am for lying, hiding stuff, learning my lesson, yet doing that over again.\n\nhere's me yapping. this story begins before the finals of my sophomore year in high school, since it was just before the finals, barely anyone was coming to the school, i felt lonely, there was another guy, Alex in my class who was similar to me, we became friends, good friends and eventually, best friends.\n\nsophomore year ended strong, we cried, did well on the finals, and were heading on towards the junior year, Alex was no longer in the same class as mine, he had a huge friend circle, probably one of the coolest groups of the entire school, i wanted to be a part of that, so i moulded my personality just to fit in with those popular guys, i wanted to be popular. i made two friends in this way, who were Alex's friends, let's call them Anna and Stella.\n\nin my junior year, i grew a thing for this girl, Natalie who comes on the same bus as mine, i used to text her, talk too her for hours, moulded my personality so that she'd like me as well, and she became a friend. i never had the guts to actually ask her out, so she was the one who did that. thus starts the relationship i'd probably remember for my entire life, it taught me everything abt girls, abt boundaries, abt the importance of communication, being honest, being loyal and being committed in a relationship, i'll always love her.\n\njust a few days down the line, another girl's letter appeared on my desk outta the blue, and i realised it was a girl from the class next to mine. now i'd a friend, Kevin, who'd warned me abt this girl, let's call her Georgina. he'd told me that she's a \"pick me\" girl, and that she'd manipulate me, tell her sad stories and stuff, turns out, he was right all the way, he's always been right.\n\nso every other day, there'd be a letter from her, and i wouldn't just acknowledge her, and one day, i just told her upfront that i'm dating Natalie, and we can just be friends at the very best. i didn't talk to her much, she acted all sad and shit, and vented about me to Stella, her and Stella were friends. Stella and Alex talked to me abt Georgina and suggested me to just \"be friends\" with her. i considered them to be my best friends, and did just that.\n\nnow, Georgina started texting me, talking all kinds of shit, she was overstepping her boundaries, and i was such an idiot to not realise that. she'd send me whole paras, even analysed my handwriting from my test paper  she went out of bounds to get her hands on that , and just flirted with me and i didn't even realise since i was way too naive, and Natalie was my first real gf, and i had absolutely no idea about the concept of \"boundaries\", or even if i did, i was a eff-boy or somn and wanted to eff around ig  it appears to be exactly like that to everyone i know and was friends with , but i'm sure that i was just stupid honestly.\n\nNatalie did know abt those letters from her, but didn't know that i'd been texting her, i just didn't tell her cuz i was afraid of what she might think of me to even thinking about texting a girl who obviously has a thing for me and just pretending to be friends with her.  big red flag, and this is exactly what bit me in the end, all along .\n\nso Natalie had the credentials to my socials  i'd given them to her as part of a trust building exercise, very very important in a relationship, and this is exactly where i've effed up, continuously . and the one time she went through my texts, she read the texts between me and Georgina. ofc she was heartbroken, i apologised so much to her, i kept reassuring her, told her my side of the story, abt how Alex and Stella suggested me to be friends with her, and how i couldn't/didn't want to tell her about it, i accepted my mistake, and promised her to never ever do so again  yet i did , and apologised to her abt betraying her trust, for hurting her, and ghosted Georgina.\n\nso Natalie was the one person who was my bestest friend, my biggest cheerleader, and i'd tell her everything from the bad stuff at my home  it's all good now , to even my most intimate and biggest secrets and insecurities, i trust her with my life, even though i've lost her.\n\nafter the mid-terms  still the Junior year , i grew closer to Alex, Stella and Anna. we were a great group of friends, i considered them to be my best friends, and somewhere along the way, i started prioritising them over Natalie  another red flag . i started telling them everything abt my life, even the the most little thing that'd bug me, and even abt my relationship with Natalie.\n\nso, i've some great parents, idk why but i just hated them at the time, but now i just get how they must've felt/are feeling. they're kinda strict abt dating in high school, as most parents are in India, and are always concerned about whom i hang out with, where do i go, what do i do, etc. now most teenagers would hate that, and probably call them helicopter parents, but at the end of the day, i'm their dear child, they work so hard to earn for me, so that i can study with the best resources, so that i end up richer than they ever were, they always think the best for me.\n\nnow, i'd lie to them about my grades, source edit them online, and just give dumb excuses when the one time  probably one in 50  when they'd actually find out, and i won't study, i'd just binge watch, listen to music, text ppl all day, and just \"pretend\" to study for their sake.\n\nso, in winter, me and Natalie went to the School Carnival, this was probably the only real date we ever went on, and boy it was a lousy one. now the thing is, i'm an ambivert, i'm introverted around new ppl, i'm introverted abt dating in public, but extroverted around ppl i know. so yeah, i was all uptight, and wouldn't even hold her hand and hug her, she felt that i was embarrassed about her, and texted me about that night.\n\nofcourse i ran straight to Alex for help, and i don't know what even happened, somehow it ended with me dramatising abt the whole thing being a \"break up\"  attention-seeking, drama causing, big red flag . soon enough, i reassured Natalie about the whole being introverted and nervous thing. New Years went by.\n\nwe still had some unresolved issues about Georgina, and cleared them the very same night. and my stupid self went on to comment \"hot damn, call the po-lice and the fireman\" to one of Stella's post  it was a public post . Natalie found out abt that and was so heartbroken. i knew no boundaries and just did that outta nowhere, i didn't even see her that way.\n\ni ran straight to Alex, Stella and Anna for help, and talked to Natalie about how it meant nothing  another red flag . somehow, we dealt with that, and it ended up with Stella convincing her how it means nothing. Natalie always resented her.\n\nJunior year finals pass by, my relationship had had it's ups and downs, but it was stable at the time. one day, Natalie would give me an ultimatum to choose between her and Stella, and i told her that i chose her hastily and ran to Alex for help. now him and i tried to convince her to reconsider the ultimatum but couldn't get her to do so.\n\nit ended up with Alex and Stella convincing me that Natalie was being unreasonable here, and we should probably take a month long break from the relationship, and so i did. but i ended that break the very next day cuz i loved her too much, but i didn't have to abide by the ultimatum. they told me that this was the last time they were helping me w my dramatic love life, and the next time we fight, they suggested me to cut ties w her.\n\nnow, all the junior year students go to a school trip for 5 days. and on that trip, one of Georgina's friends, Axel  also Alex's friend  kept asking what'd i think of her, and i was like \"yeah, she's a good person, but i don't see her that way at all.\" then he asked me if i wanted to fix shit with her in such a cunning way that if iwere to say no to that, i'd look like a heartless, effboy jerk.\n\ncooincidently, i broke my dominant arm on that trip, and Georgina was being all so dramatic. she threw such a tantrum that Stella had to beg me to talk to her, i did that, heard to what she had to yap about and went on by my business.\n\ndays past, the Senior year starts off, and Natalie talks to Alex threw a mutual friend, and everyone found out about how i'd dramatised about the carnival incident, and how i'd lied to her about she being the only person i share my insecurities, the oddities life throws at me, and the fights with my parents. i hurt her again, and had no idea how to go by about it, i couldn't even wrap my mind around the idea that she was gonna confront me, and i just shyed away from that and wouldn't even talk to her. i thought abt Alex and Stella told me to cut ties off w her the next time we fight.\n\nthat went on in my head, and i just convinced myself to break it up w her, and even bitched abt her to Kevin, who told me that \"it's not my place to tell you what to do, i don't meddle in relationships, but i told you from day one, that Alex and others are no good\". i still tried to apologise to Alex and the others, Anna was the only one who'd talk to me, but she too got fed up w me and my drama.\n\ni regretted breaking up, i lost my very dear gf, my then best friends, everyone, it was a rough phase, my grades began declining, i'd sit alone, i had a broken dominat arm from the trip, i wouldn't study at all, i resented that, kinda still do but am working on it. Kevin was there w me, he said that \"besties always stay no matter how much a bro ever fucks up, they'll always have the bro's back, and i have ur back\". this made me realise that Alex, Stella and Anna weren't besties to me at all.\n\ni wasn't doing any well academically, and one day my parents actually found out that i'd been lying to them and were so disappointed. i've infinite backlog, i wanna work hard towards JEE. my parents were so heartbroken, they'd been working hard just for me, and i was betraying them. my mom cried, has had sleepless nights worrying abt me. i promised her to work hard, to do well on JEE., and she's been motivating me, trying to help me manage the little time i have until JEE, even tho i've improved, i've started studying just a bit, but it's nowhere near what i can and what i should be doing. it's barely 10% of that, i wanna work hard towards that.\n\ndays past, i'm getting over Natalie, and one fine day, Georgina starts talking to me, telling me how she was right about Natalie being a shitty person  she isn't, not even one bit . i wanted to hate Natalie at the time, so i went on yapping abt her. little did i know, Georgina was manipulating me again, kept telling me abt her sad stories, gained sympathy, and guilt tripped me abt how me ghosting her has caused her grades to slip, how she'd had sleepless nights, how her health detoriated, how she tried doing self harm.\n\nthat guilt got into me quite bad, i'd no idea to deal with it, and started sweet talking  almost flirting  with her, apologising, and whatnot. now this timeline was so hazy, i didn't even realise that me and Natalie hadn't even actually broken up yet. her stupid friend even clicked a photo of me w her  even tho i'm decently away from her, that photo sure looks like i'm staring at that Georgina .\n\nso Natalie texts me we're over, days past by, i'm trying to move on, but couldn't, and still kept texting Georgina  it legit looked like i had a thing for her, but i was just manipulated and guilt struck. i made a new friend along the way, Andrew, the bestest one i've ever had. him and Austin  a guy i've been friends with since we were 7  are my homies.\n\n2 months later, Natalie asks me if i wanna be friends again, i said yes, and the very next day, she said that she'd missed me and wanted us to be a thing again, i said yes to that as well. life was becoming better, or so i thought. the relationship was going smooth this time, i didn't want to repeat the same mistakes again, and ghosted off Georgina again after 4 days we got back together. i didn't tell her that i'd been talking to Georgina, i just didn't want to be in such a difficult situation of losing Natalie again.\n\none day, Natalie sends me a piece of text asking me if i'd sent that to Georgina, and my first instinct was to lie. but in the very next text, i told her, yeah, it was me, explaining my story, saying that it was from when we'd broken up but the dates in my story didn't match  cuz we hadn't broken up officially yet . she got mad at me, confronted me, and i tried explaining her that i didn't ever have a thing for Georgina.\n\nwe dealt w that, and i promised her to yell at Georgina the very next morning that \"i don't want anything to do with her\". sadly, school turned out to be off for the next 2 days  until today .\n\nmy mom found out abt Natalie, she'd always suspected me dating abt her from a letter she found while organising my stuff, she was hurt too that i'd lied to her, hid it from her inspite her telling me otherwise.  second time she found out about me dating, first one was back in Sophomore year from a so-called relationship that was just to show-off and be cool in high school .\n\nnow, she told me to get rid of my insta, and i pretended to do just that, and didn't even come online yesterday and even today. but i knew that i had to deal with the fight w Natalie. she and Georgina exchange texts meanwhile, Georgina sends her all screenshots in which it appears like i'm flirting with her, basically cheating on Natalie just before the break up.  i find it so weird that Georgina is doing it now, 2 whole months after we got back together, and even tho i've lied and hid stuff, i'm being framed by her, she even told her that i danced w her on the trip which isn't true at all . even tho i was pretty shitty, but i'm sure Georgina is manipulating her against me, she knew damn well that i texted her out of guilt, i made sure that one of her friends, Aaaron knew abt it.\n\nnow, i tie up Andrew in the crossfire, i didn't tell him abt the content of those texts to Georgina, but he basically knew what had been. Natalie talked to him last night, sent him those screenshots and he was very pissed at me that i'd been lying to him as well.\n\nhe calls me up today at noon, confronting me, i told him my version of the story, abt the whole guilt tripping, manipulating, and sent him screenshots between me and one of Georgina's friends  Aaron  clearly stating that i had no such thing for her, and was doing so just outta guilt. i had deleted all texts relating to Georgina, but ended up recovering the ones that'd show my pov, the pov which is highly reasonable, full of stuff that i hid from and lied about to Natalie.\n\nmy parents are heartbroken, Natalie's heartbroken, Andrew is pissed at me  but still is helping me w Natalie since i'm not using insta outta guilt cuz my mom found out, and probably is the last time will ever help me since i lied to him as well . Natalie is broken to the point that she even texted Andrew and Austin from my account sharing all those screenshots and that photo of me with Georgina.\n\nit appears that i'd been cheating on Natalie, there's no way she's gonna stay, the best i can hope for is that we break up on good terms, she's gonna talk to me about the whole thing tomr and i've no idea hwat i'm gonna do or say  pretty sure i won't even be able to look at her let alone talk to her, Andrew texted her from my side providing my pov. i was giant red flag, and i regret all the shit i did. even though it looks all bad, i learnt a whole lot from it and would remember it for the rest of my life. i'll always love Natalie\n\nthe lesson i learnt all along was that you can never buy your way out of difficult situations just by hiding or lying stuff, sooner or later, all the shady stuff that you've did is unearthed and you're much worse than you could've been if you could've just accepted and told the truth in the first place. i feel bad about what i did to my parents. the key to any sort of relationship  be it a s/o, parents, friends, etc.  is honest and true communication. and communication becomes key especially in difficult times, when ur grades are bad, when u feel lonely, when it feels like the end of life, when you feel guilty, when u're down the wrong path. instead of pushing these feelings away, it's better to talk about them with your closest ppl be it anyone, bit someone's gotta know that you're not okay, esp when you're down the wrong path.\n\nthere'll always be some one ready to jump into that pool of shit you're drowning in, to help you out. and life isn't hedonistic at all, you gotta earn your place, you gotta dream big, aim high, and work goddamn hard towards it  i'm saying this while having infinite backlog and preparing for JEE . there's no easy way ever, there'll always be ups and downs, we just gotta make sure that those downs don't kill our spirit, our dreams, or just depress us to the point we feel like doing nothing.\n\nnow, after all of this, i wanna be a better person, i wanna work hard towards my dream of getting into a good college, i wanna study for 12 hours straight, i don't wanna lie anymore, i wanna be brutally honest, be truthful, be humble, be polite, be respectful towards everyone. i wanna get rid of procrastination  doing exactly that rn , get rid of my poor attention span, enjoy studying, be happy, enjoy the hard and cruel journey towards my dream, not being wound sad ever along the way, and just be happy.\n\ni'm sorry for typing out such a long story, i hope that you learnt something from it and don't make the same mistakes i did, and just be happy and healthy.\n\nTLDR: i'd been a sociopath, i lied to my friends, my parents, hid stuff from my s/o, stopped studying, lied about my grades, learnt a life lesson, and wanna be a better person now, work towards my dream and not procrastinate, and wanna be happy, everyone deserves to be happy.\n\nUpdate: Natalie and I fought for 2 days, she said she wanted space and wouldn't text me back and asked me to not text her, that's what i did. Andrew's been busy w his stuff, we have an upcoming exam, he's been studying for that, we haven't talked yet. Last night, Natalie said that maybe we should end things cuz they aren't working out, and we can stay friends and maybe date later on if we still feel the same way about each other. yeah, things ended on good terms ig. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1erbgz7/to_anyone_whod_wanna_listen_to_my_story/",

We had a really deep convo that lasted from 10 pm to 1am and it was the best conversation that either of us had ever had in our life. We both said that we trusted each other so much after that. We text every single night for hours yet he doesn't like me. I might even love him. He likes another girl and is really in love with her and has been for years. We share music playlists with each other and talk about EVERYTHING. Nothing is off limits at all. From periods to sex to depression, we talk about everything. He's my best friend yet I feel insignificant in his eyes. He's always hurting me but it's probably an accident. We BOTH said smash to each other in smash or pass and literally wrote essays to each other on why  he wrote more than I did and it was awesome  and that really messed w my head bc why is he leading me on if we are just friends? Also he said one time to make his point \"we don't even text that often\" when we literally text on a DAILY BASIS. That really hurt my feelings. He also takes like 15m to respond to my first few texts in a conversation. I always get so jealous too when he talks to me about other girls that he likes. I think he doesn't like me bc I'm out of his league and not his type  he goes for white and pretty ppl and I'm not either  even tho he's told me a million times that looks don't rly matter to him. He did call me pretty when we were having a convo about our insecurities and stuff and also in the smash essay paragraph thing. But I'm actually ugly and he's hot and popular. Even tho he's popular, he's an absolute sweetheart. He said period blood isn't gross, it's just blood. He also bought chocolate for a random girl once bc she had period cramps!! He told me that my future soulmate is extremely lucky to have me- multiple times. I just feel so confused with him and need advice on what to do/how to deal with this.

    75: "First post Alright everybody. This is my first post on Reddit, ever. I just turned 18 literally a week ago, so I'm a bit late to the party but I've wanted to go on here for the longest time to see what my peers are up to. I guess I'll start with the general stuff.\n\nMy favorite music artists are Tame Impala, Michael Jackson, Foo Fighters, and honestly the list goes on forever but what can I say, music is my life.\nI sing and play keyboard, and I dabble with bass guitar here and there. My favorite games include the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise, specifically 1-5 because after that the story got a little too convoluted for my liking, Death Stranding for the PlayStation, really solid story and gameplay throughout, and I also play a lot of Mario games on my switch. Also I will say I really enjoy the insomniac Spider Man games, I have played 1 and 2 plus Miles Morales.\n\nI have severe depression and social anxiety, might be a misanthrope but I can't say for sure. If I'm feeling suicidal I will just stay in bed all day and try to sleep the day off, I've tried to commit suicide once before but I guess it wasn't my time to go.\nUm what else,\nMy favorite fast food restaurant is Popeyes but my favorite food ever is probably Southside Six which is located over on the South Side of Bowling Green, excellent Mediterranean food. Highly recommend if you're in Ohio.\n\nYou could call me a loner, I mean I distance myself from people as much as I can, I just don't feel like they will add to my life, but then again maybe I haven't met the right people yet. Maybe I will meet one of those people on here. But maybe I won't.\n\nHowever I'm a big believer that all of you on here are young beautiful talented individuals, and don't let anyone make you think otherwise. You have your whole life ahead of you and you have so much time, as do I, to accomplish your goals and aspirations. All of you have potential to do amazing things. You deserve happiness and you deserve to live a life you want to live without anyone giving you shit for it. Keep your head held high.\n\nBlake out https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1dn5dey/first_post/",

    78: "i feel like im weird  a lot of text down here  tl;dr : im not following the \"normal\" way in practically anything and i am, to put it mildly, not ok with it.\n\n\nas i get closer to the age of m18  borderline minor  and university life, i have yet to experience things other people did basically for granted. im just blank. to me personally it feels like i have no personality. no idea what other people think of me though, but they are not the main problem. today i talked to my broskis on discord as per usual, when one of them mentioned how old games were better than new AAA titles. i asked him to define what \"old\" game is. he said those would've been stalker series, gta, need for speed and some other racing games, dying light etc.\n\nit didn't *hit* me with the fact that i didn't know those games' names, i had it in my mind that i've never played any GTA in my life and i wouldn't say i have a flaming desire to. but he was shocked. it felt like in his mind it was so baked in for all gamers to have at least once in their life complete GTA:SA.\n\nthere's a lot more to say in this branch of same character. i barely have any hours on CS and can't relate to people complaining about how csgo was golden and how much cs2 sucks compared to it. i can't say for sure if i have ever slain ender dragon in MC in survival. im not sure if i have even a quarter of some sort of essential bucket list crossed out. i did play a lot of flash games when flash player was still alive, i even installed flashpoint to pay a visit to some of my favourites. but even HERE i have white spots, there are flash games that probably everyone but me has played and unfortunately i have no desire to try them.\n\nso that was just gaming. precisely, PC gaming, since i only played console at my friends' places, definitely not enough to develop some feelings. i've had this in my head for a while and realised that there are also books, many books that i should have read by now, but i didn't. in some of them i have no interest. same with films and TV series.\n\nnext branch would be music, although it's a lenient one for me. i have already accepted the fact that my music taste is a bit more niche than everyone else's in my surroundings. however the very first musical instrument that i decided to give a try was.... diatonic harmonica. very obscure choice, considering the difficulties it has compared to more \"normal\" instruments. im trying to make progress on it and i do make it, but it's no secret that many people absolutely HATE the sound of it. why didn't i try other stuff then? piano seemed boring as hell to me. guitar i simply didn't try just yet, might give it a shot later in the future.\n\nthe next thing is probably sport and other similar activities. i don't understand the gimmick of playing or watching football  soccer if you're american reading this , i didn't stick with the martial arts. i spent 5 months practicing kickboxing  idk, can it be called sports club? , almost a year in aikido and none of those did i get hook on. so my mom decided to yeet me in the billiard club and honestly... it might look like im having fun but deep inside me there's something telling me that it's not my thing despite the fact that im going there for almost 4 years so far. i signed up for the gym in february but initially it was because i felt like i had to. i had this relatively basic idea of bodybuilding at least something worth looking at. and you know, physical activities can help with mental health a bit. im not making much progress there, but this is a tiny part where i can be at least thankful that i did something.\n\nhell, even food is a hard topic imo. everyone around me has absolutely no problem with eating, their weight is in normal condition. and then there's me who manages to survive on solar energy, sometimes for 12 hours without my stomach aching.\n\nand im not gonna start on relationship branch. i simply didn't reach a certain level yet to have a gf and tbh there's nothing to be angry at myself for. though i do have at least one person whom i can call a true friend.\n\nthe obscurity of my hobbies is.... undeniable. who ON EARTH would deem me interesting when i play billiard, chess and harp  just to seem normal, ignoring the fact that i do that poorly , along the fact that i have never played CoD or even watched Fight Club? i can't even think of any significant achievement of mine to bring up in a dialogue.\n\nwhen talking to other people i got used to memorizing details from films i never watched, the lore of the games i never played and covering up the holes in myself which would otherwise lead to marking me a NPC and \"boring person\". the solution to this seems easy: just go experience it all right now.... but it's only like that on paper. im fed up with this feeling of not knowing what i like, even though im barely making any moves to fix that.\n\n\nsumming it up, i wouldn't say this is a cry for help. it's just a bullshit state of mind i've been in for the past two years.\n\ni sincerely apologize for the amount of depressive boring shit of a complaint that i've just spent maybe an hour on. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1emmhax/i_feel_like_im_weird_a_lot_of_text_down_here/",

    86: "Some indie music I collect I don’t have much to say as a foreword but this might be a pretty long list. The genres generally fall into rock, with a bit of swing, rap, and some stuff where I really don’t even know the name of the genre is how alt it gets. So instead of sticking to genres I’m just gonna give a brief description of the vibe. You should also know I'm woefully ignorant of genres, so I may just get stuff completely wrong. Please help.\n\nAlso, I don’t really listen to artists as much as I listen to individual songs I like  indie stuff is pretty hit or miss because they don’t need to pander to an audience; blessing and a curse , so each artist is gonna have my favorite songs. I encourage you to ignore me and try all of it. With that out of the way here is list. If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing just comment what your vibe is and I can recommend.\n\nThe Vanished People: My most recent discovery, and inspired the making of this list. The songs vary widely, but share a bright rock vibe driven by guitar, bass, and vocals. The lyrics range between soulful and fun, but are always interesting. Favorite songs are Glass Moon Dance and Queen of the Night. This shit is so good it literally pulled me out of depression. I wish that were an exaggeration.\n\nFelix Hagan and the Family: On directly the opposite end of the spectrum, Felix is about the edgiest I’ve got. Very drum and bass heavy tracks supporting similarly heavy lyrics. This shit is so edgy they’ve got a song called Delirium Tremendous. Oh you know, just a pun on *fatal alcohol poisoning.* That and On the Double are my faves.\n\nFever Dolls: The only song of theirs I like is Gennifer Flowers. It’s very hard to explain this one, so give it a listen if you want. Bass-heavy and hectic.\n\nThe Brobecks: Referred to as indie pop  isn’t that an oxymoron? Anyway , these guys are guitar-heavy with some guy absolutely murdering the drums  but they have good audio balancing so it’s not bad . They mix in a fun bit of piano between loud and heartfelt lyrics. You can tell I’m a sucker for good lyrics. Anyway, I like Better than Me.\n\nAir Traffic Controller: indie pop again  I'll stop questioning it, fine  with a lot of EDM and driving drums, plus some tasteful piano. Their first three songs jump from toxic relationship to insomnia to \"shit I gotta get to work\" and somehow the last one is the saddest so you just know these lyrics are incredible. Big fan of Creature of the Night and Hurry Hurry.\n\nDirt Poor Robins: back to indie rock, these two combine profoundly sad lyrics with much more upbeat piano, drums, brass... I mean everything but strings really. I'm not sure how to describe them, it's very grandiose and yet sad, indomitable human spirit style. I like Lady Hell and Enchante\n\nAnybody who's made it this far probably already knows about Will Wood, but this is here just in case. If you don't know Will Wood... fix that.\n\nSteam-Powered Giraffe: No, don't double take. This is an indie list, you knew it had to get weird. Pretty obviously these guys are a steampunk theme band  they actually perform in full costume, but I'm not a concert guy so never been. Feel free to flame me for not going to concerts, my friends will do it better . These guys have such an unprecedented amount of quality and quantity for a smaller band, and despite being steampunk they have plenty of excellent music that completely ignores the theme. I'm a fan of I'll Rust With You, Shattered Stars, and Latum Alterum.\n\nDemondice: It's edgy again! Japanese/English rap, so I don't understand half of it, but it's supported by exciting tracks that range between jazzy and airy. The lyrics are, as far as I know, pretty dark and sometimes sorrowful. I'm a fan of Hazy Skyscraper and Dark Hour.\n\nJukebox the Ghost: I'm not sure what these guys are doing, apparently they're power pop and I don't know what that means. Whatever it is, Ramona and Under my Skin have lyrics that I really enjoy, and whoever's singing is absolutely killing it. Lots of bouncy piano, light drum and guitar.\n\nJharaih: Very high-octane punk that leans heavily on vocals thanks to an absolutely beautiful voice just screaming his lungs out. The instruments are hectic and accelerated. A must listen for anyone who likes punk... anything really. I like Risk Risk Risk, A Lesson in Dramatics, and Pressure Bomb.\n\nFish in a Birdcage: You will get turned off by the fact that the first song is called Rule #34. You will then quickly realize this was an inevitability, as every single song is called Rule #X. This is natural. Jokes aside, each song varies, from the old-timey piano of Rule 15 - Four Aces to spirited violin of Rule 4 - Fish in a Birdcage  my two favorites, Rule 4 being one of my all-time favorites. I relate to it.  Most songs have at least some smooth and uncluttered violin, but what ties them all together is the love poured into every single lyric, and the buttery voice of our protagonist. Each song is a story and world all on its own.\n\nGood Kid: More popular than most on this list, but what matters is that it's good, not that it's indie. I think you  might have actually heard these guys if you're on Twitch often, since they don't issue strikes. Anyway, these guys make high-energy, guitar-driven rock with fun lyrics. The kind of thing you listen to at 1:30AM on an electric scooter. Because that's obviously a universal experience. I like Mimi's Delivery Service, No Time to Explain, First Rate Town, and Witches.\n\nDom Fera: I'm not 100% sure how to describe it, and clearly he doesn't either bc I can't find a lick of info besides the fact that he's also a writer and director. Nothing super special going on musically, but I just absolutely love the lyrics. My favorites are Nothing to Say, Breathe, and Monster Song.\n\nRyan Ike: Despite being a video game soundtrack artist, this man consistently produces bangers in low, soulful strums of western guitars and the excellent vocal talent that his sponsors pull in. He's made music for the West of Loathing Series and Wizard with a Gun, but by far his best music is from the least well-known title, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine. I like Heavy Hands and Vagrant Song the most. If you like the country vibe but not the modernized version that appears in today's music, give him a listen. Also try the game, it's not much, but it has soul.  and it's cheap as dirt too lmao, on sale for like 2 bucks periodically \n\nDeath Cab for Cutie: Fairly well-known for an indie band, this is the part of the list where my vinyl-obsessed brother's influence begins to bare its teeth. Death Cab for Cutie makes mellow music with overlayed guitars and gentle drums, just to support lyrics that are absolutely full of soul, sorrow, and hope. Genuinely enough to make you cry. I like Asphalt Meadows, Here to Forever, and Soul Meets Body.\n\nCosmic Johnny: And in the opposite direction, one of the smallest on the list, this guy's got less than 10k monthly listeners. As indie as they come. Not be confused with Johnny Cosmic, who I did not know existed until they took over my search results. lol. Anyway this is pretty basic punk rock, but for some reason it just resonates with me. I love the lyrics, they really mean something and clearly are personal. I like Sleep with a Baseball Bat and Useless Machine. Yeah, punk shit.\n\nThe Crane Wives: Folk indie band with lots of pretty chords and plucked strings, as well as haunting backup vocals and beautiful harmonies. Each song tells a story, as befits a folk band. I find it very relaxing to listen to while driving. My favorites are Take Me to War  so relaxing, huh?  and Metaphor.\n\nThe Unlikely Candidates: These guys do whatever they want, and the only song I really like is Danger To Myself  please do not worry for my mental health; as mentioned before, that is being dealt with . It's rock, it's alt, it's punk, it's loud and proud and has some truly outstanding vocals.\n\nJack Cambell: Also very very small indie, Jack's work is surprisingly light and airy for what is ostensibly a punk rock band. It feels like it really leaves room for what they want to say to be heard, which is good because their lyrics are sad and soulful. The whole experience feels like looking up at the sky in the middle of a city. It's heavy, but also a breath of fresh air. I like Absentee, Home Alone, and Scared of Heights.\n\nCamino 84: I am truly honored to be one of less than 20k people who listen to this guy on the monthly because holy hell is it some of the best music I know. Staccato funk guitar, disco vibes, and powerful but understated bass, the music itself is a smooth groove. The lyrics are serious, meaningful, and beautifully written. Please listen to this stuff, I love it and you just might. Favorites are Little Too Late, Responsible, and Never Be Alone.\n\nGo! Child: I think this might be the last on the list, but you probably know better than I do since you can see the end, and I'm writing. Would be pretty funny to not stop here, huh? Well, Go! Child is a very electronic indie pop thing. I only really like Good Morning and Atlanta, both from their album Coffee and Ramen. It's very hit or miss stuff, but give them a shot if you like chiptune with some actual lyrics.\n\nThe Postal Service: Not the end, I totally forgot these guys. More of my brother's vinyls, this is also electronic indie, just better. It's very much one of those signpost indie bands. Look, just listen to Such Great Heights and you'll see what I mean. It's hard to describe.\n\nRare Americans: These guys deserve more attention. It's alt rock and, look, I know I keep harping on about lyrics and lyrics and such, but these are something special. Their songs really touch on the complexity of human life in an unprecedented way. Each one is brimming with hope and despair, and you can really feel the voice of the masses through their music.\n\nAnd there you go! Basically my whole spotify library.

    91: "Au revoir to my hopes and dreams of finding a meaningful relationship. TL;DR, Got friend zoned and I didn't care, now I feel like shit.  \n  \n**For those who have the attention span of longer than that of a Gen Z I-pad kid, here's the full story:**  \n\n\nLast year, I  16 at the time  Began to date my current ex  15, but would be 16 in a month  Mid-June. Come October, she broke up with me. It sucked. Loneliness, depression, constant feeling that I'm not good enough for anyone, yada yada yada.  \n\n\nFast forward to last week. I  Now 17  and the entirety of my schools musical cast are gearing up for our first shows and going through our final dress rehearsals. I was lucky enough to land a somewhat major lead. The female lead of my cast  18  and I had been nervous for ages, but after a couple of really solid dress rehearsals, we both felt very confident. However, nobody knew that I had feelings for her, and had them for at least 2 months.  \nI tell one person. That turns to two, to four etc. Eventually, basically everybody in the cast aside from the female lead I like and a handful of other people who want no business in my business knew.  \nI said I didn't care if she found out. The very first person I told talks to her over snap and, with me waiting with bated breath, tells her of my little crush on her.  \nI got friendzoned. Now, this isn't what hurt me the most. It's how I reacted to being told this news.  \nI was in full \"It is what it is\" mode.   \nThis hurts me. I hold love as an incredibly high value, and to see me brush it off in this manner makes me feel like the scum of the earth. I feel like I've quit trying to find actual love for some reason. I feel like being rejected or accepted by someone for my longing for them doesn't matter, as if I'd date them because I had the slightest interest in them. Now, I don't know what to do with myself. Yay. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1e6l8hx/au_revoir_to_my_hopes_and_dreams_of_finding_a/",

    93: "Whatever you do, don't lose hope I don't know who needs to hear this but please, don't give up.\n\nFor many years I have been considered an outcast and had one friend for many, many years and whenever we couldn't hang out I got sad because being friendless is quite the bummer but i also got sad when he'd judge me for weird things i'd like. Some of you may still be in the situation even now, or at least in a situation where you spend your time with people who don't understand or even really like you.\n\nAt one point I befriended a classmate who was completely different from me and a polar opposite by just playing roblox with him. Somehow we ended up getting closer and we got each other through the worst times and even learned a lot from each other. He used to be homophobic and when we hung out with a person I know that is part of the lgbt he found out that they're just as nice as anyone else making me feel so proud when he defended my gay friend from some douchebags who think they're better than him for \"not being gay\". We are currently best friends.\n\nEven one time when I was alone outside, I managed to get the courage to talk to a person who was visibly into \"weirder\" stuff  by weird we're talking anime or \"unusual\" music  and he, to this day, accepts me the way I am and never once judged me on things I can't change or my rather obscure interests.\n\nPlease trust me when I say that there will *always* be someone who wants to be your friend despite some of your bad traits. Even if you're depressed, even if you listen to music that most people don't like or listen to, even if you don't like the stuff they like, even if you consider yourself \"ugly\".\n\nOne thing that I personally recommend is using the line \"worst thing that may happen is them saying no\" when you feel unable to go up to a person you find interesting for if they decline, you have a lot more people whether it's irl or online. Also, if you want to fit in more, try and take interest in things that are common wherever you live. Maybe I don't like the movies my best friend or the music he listens to but I will gladly do my research and show interest in things he likes. By doing that I managed to, in a way, \"befriend\" the person that bullied me for many years and we even hung out  in a group  a few times.\n\nAll I'm saying is that *you* are the only one who can fix your problems and it's up to you to become the person you'd like to be little by little. Don't set high expectations as none of us are perfect, just try to aim towards being a likeable human being.\n\nI only wish love for all of you and hope it helped everyone  or at least most people  who took the time to read this.\n\nKeep your hope up, even if it's little https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1ec9qyj/whatever_you_do_dont_lose_hope/",

    96: "how to be happy+ life lesson on suffering  read this if ur feeling hopeless so I knock sense into u \n\nI don't feel like life is meant to be suffering. I don't think we should spend the rest of our lives believing that we are meant to suffer and nothing else. I like what Viktor Frankl said- \"If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an eradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.\" \"The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life.\"  Totally recommend looking into this guy if you are having an existential crisis. \n\nDon't read that if you don't want to lol, but basically I can't go about life believing that we can't accept good because there is suffering. A lot of people on this subreddit are young, and already accepting horrible beliefs that will probably dictate the rest of their life. You aren't meant to be sad, honestly, it's pathetic and useless to see life that way. I'm quite literally clinically depressed with a genetic imbalance of my serotonin levels, but after years of failing and crying and living in the cave that my room had become, I realized that I was already dead. I had loved nothing and felt nothing, I was basically a corpse in a breathing skin. We have eternity, eventually, to be dead, so just spend this short time to live. You won't experience it again, lol.  You aren't meant to vape and be a drug addict and live with an ed and become an early alcoholic. You aren't meant to die alone and be hated by your family and be a victim to capitalism. Dude, shut up and do something with your life, it's getting annoying. Just live.\n\nDo what makes you happy  and no, you don't find happiness in hurting your body through harmful coping mechanisms . Find what actually makes you happy. You have to come to a point in your life where you realize that you have a lot of control over the way your life will unfold. Stop blaming your sadness or trauma on others. I promise that it is truly not your fault that you've become this person with a really painful past, but it is your fault if you let yourself stay this way.\n\nI hope you guys get what I mean and it doesn't fly over your head, but I want everyone to know it isn't hopeless. Life isn't hopeless unless you accept it to be, tbh. You can continue calling people delusional for changing their perspective on a situation but if that's delusion, then we are all guilty of it.\n\nOne more devious quote, by Einstein- “everything is energy and that’s all there is to it. March the frequency of the reality you want and you can’t help but get it. It can be no other way. This is not philosophy, this is physics.” I’m not talking about weird wizard stuff, it’s the idea that you can make your life whatever you want it to be. It’s just a sort of law of the universe that you will notice/find stuff bad or good if you look for it. Stop being a pessimist, unless, of course, you are a masochistic mf who doesn’t want happiness and deep down has already lost their soul and any ounce of humanity. Then whatever, be miserable, I don’t care. Just wanted to remind some people who still have faith in theirselves that you can live a good life. Suffering will happen, but life isn’t about suffering, it’s about your reaction and perseverance to it. If you stayed until the end of this, I applaud you. Now go read a book or something. Lower your 18 hour screen time lol.  Also talking to myself here. \n\n\nSome stuff to do to be happy:\n\nFind a side hustle to make money in a way that makes you proud and isn’t corrupt.  Money=security. Security=good. \n\nDo something hygienic lol, take a shower, or paint your nails  despite ur gender lol , or shave- do something that makes you feel like you look good. \n\nActually workout in a fun way. You don’t have to torture yourself, go on a hike or drive to a rock climbing wall. Find exhilaration and enjoyment in whatever you experiment in. \n\nNot to sound corny to some of you but deadass pick up a piece of paper and write down everything that’s on ur mind. Journaling isn’t cringy, it really stops the jam of thoughts in ur brain. Just try. Burn the paper afterward if you want. I have been writing down whatever bothers me for like 3 years and it never failed to help me figure out why I do what I do.\n\nGo to therapy…tbh. Or just research psychology and trauma responses so you understand your identity and your “flaws,” and how they came to be. \n\n\nCook. Try making orzotto with spinach sauce. Or bake tiramisu, idk. Cooking is an awesome skill for all people.\n\n\nArt. Draw cartoons or album covers, paint an apple, or a funny picture with Drake but instead of Drake it’s an apple. \n\nWatch Deadpool. Both of em. how couldn’t you be happy after seeing Ryan Reynolds\n\nMake something. Be proud of it. Make a piece of music or write something, make a collection of moths idk, just do something.\n\nI cannot stress this one enough- put ur phone high up where you can’t reach, then leave your room and sit somewhere with the most nature accessible. If ur scared of social settings, go somewhere private. If you can’t access the outdoors, go to a window. And just stare, especially during sunset or sunrise. Grandmas know what they are doing. It’s high-key so fun to just be around a beautiful setting and think. Don’t hate it until you try it. \n\nPut your headphones on a reasonably high volume and play one of those songs with the best bass drop ever and dance, it’s really a euphoric feeling… I like it better than drugs 💀\n\nTalk to a friend. But a friend that doesn’t shit on u, and instead actually makes you feel like you are uplifted and able to grow. Never try to be the best person in your friend group. You don’t need an ego boost, you need to be in a healthy environment where everyone has strengths. Laugh with somebody. \n\nDo something with your siblings or parents if u are close. Something as simple as watching a sitcom can go a long way. \n\nGo somewhere cold then jump into your bed with socks on and wiggle under the covers like a bug then make fake scenarios in your head where you are living ur dream life. Because it’s kinda fun to imagine. And it makes the possibility of it a little bit more real, I think. \n\nScroll through r/ wholesome memes \n\nAlso leave all of those subreddits that you are just there to oversee the absolute bafoonerie of the people within it. The more you surround yourself with shitty people, the more shitty of a person you become. \n\nWatch Danny Gonzalez , or those Mr beast videos that are actually really sweet and make u tear up just a lil \n\n\nDo 29 pushups. \n\n\nAre these becoming more unhinged? I’ll just stop there but lemme know if you want any more happiness suggestions. Bye, don’t kill yourself. Hold it out a little longer so you can buy alcohol legally. \n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1e3iodo/how_to_be_happy_life_lesson_on_suffering/",
