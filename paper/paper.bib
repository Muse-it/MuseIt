    abstract = "{The value of music in people's everyday lives depends on the uses they make of it and the degree to which they engage with it, which are in turn dependent on the contexts in which they hear it. Very few studies have investigated people's experiences of music in naturalistic, everyday circumstances, and this exploratory study provides some initial normative data on who people listen with, what they listen to (and what their emotional responses to this music are), when they listen, where they listen, and why they listen. A total of 346 people who owned a mobile phone were sent one text message per day for 14 days. On receiving this message, participants were required to complete a questionnaire about any music they could hear, or had heard since their previous message. Responses indicated a high compliance rate; a high incidence of exposure to music; that the greatest number of musical episodes occurred while participants were on their own; that pop music was heard most frequently; that liking for the music varied depending on who the participant was with, where they were, and whether they had chosen to be able to hear music; that music was usually experienced during the course of some activity other than deliberate music listening; that exposure to music occurred most frequently in the evening, particularly between 10 pm and 11 pm, and on weekends; that music was heard most frequently at home, with only a small number of incidences occurring in public places; that the importance of several functions of music varied according to temporal factors, the place where the music was heard, and the person or people the participant was with. Further research should include participants from a greater range of sociodemographic backgrounds and should develop context-specific theoretical explanations of the different ways in which people use music as a resource.}",

    abstract = { The aim of this exploratory study was to (a) test the viability of the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) as a means of identifying unfolding episodes of everyday musical experience, (b) examine the consistency of situations where music listening occurs by comparing the findings of previous studies involving retrospective data, and (c) investigate the extent to which degree of personal choice over the music and psychological outcomes such as mood change, are associated with participants' descriptions of the functions of music in particular contexts. Eight non-musicians between the ages of 18 and 40 were asked to carry an electronic pager with them for a one-week period. A remote computer activated the pagers once at random in every two-hour period between 0800 and 2200. On each paging, participants were asked to stop what they were doing as soon as practicable and complete a diary of self-report forms with open-ended and scaled items, allowing “on the spot” thoughts and feelings in real life everyday situations to be recorded as sequential episodes. At the end of the week, each respondent was individually interviewed. Results indicated that the ESM is a robust method for exploring daily musical experiences. Although music was heard during 44\% of all episodes, few episodes involved listening to music as the primary focus. Rather, music tended to be used as an accompaniment to other activities. Findings also indicated that the experience of music resulted in participants becoming more positive, more alert, and more focussed in the present, particularly where personal choice over the music was involved. The discussion considers some of the implications of the study for future investigations of the functions of music as they occur in everyday evolving situations. }

Qualitative approaches to the study of music have uncovered rich connections between music and social context but are limited in scale, while computational approaches process large amounts of musical data but lack information on the social contexts music is embedded in. In this work, we develop a set of neural embedding methods to understand the social contexts of online music sharing, and apply them to a novel dataset containing 1.3M instances of music sharing in Reddit communities. We find that the patterns of how people share music in public are related to, but often differ from, how they listen to music in private. We cluster artists into social genres that are based entirely on aggregate sharing patterns and reflect where artists are invoked. We also characterize the social and cultural contexts music is shared in by measuring associations with social dimensions such as age and political affiliation. Finally, we observe that a significant amount of sharing is attributable to extra-musical factors—additional meanings that people have associated with songs. We develop two methods to quantify the extra-musicality of music sharing. Our methodology is widely applicable to the study of online social contexts, and our results reveal novel cultural associations that contribute to a better understanding of the online music ecosystem.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Veselovsky, Veniamin and Waller, Isaac and Anderson, Ashton}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={739-750} }

abstract="While there have been several studies on how users experience algorithmic recommendations and their explanations, we know relatively little about human recommendations and which item aspects humans highlight when describing their own recommendation needs. A better understanding of human recommendation behavior could help us design better recommender systems that are more attuned to their users. In this paper, we take a step towards such understanding by analyzing a Reddit community dedicated to requesting and providing for recommendations: {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf {\{}/r/{\}}{\backslash}textsf {\{}ifyoulikeblank{\}}{\$}{\$}/r/ifyoulikeblank. After a general analysis of the community, we provide a more detailed analysis of the prevalent music requests and the example items used to ask for these recommendations. Finally, we compare these human recommendations to algorithmic recommendations to better characterize their differences. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for recommender systems design.",

    abstract = {The psychological theory of expectation that David Huron proposes in Sweet Anticipation grew out of the author's experimental efforts to understand how music evokes emotions. These efforts evolved into a general theory of expectation that will prove informative to readers interested in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology as well as those interested in music. The book describes a set of psychological mechanisms and illustrates how these mechanisms work in the case of music. All examples of notated music can be heard on the Web.Huron proposes that emotions evoked by expectation involve five functionally distinct response systems: reaction responses (which engage defensive reflexes); tension responses (where uncertainty leads to stress); prediction responses (which reward accurate prediction); imagination responses (which facilitate deferred gratification); and appraisal responses (which occur after conscious thought is engaged). For real-world events, these five response systems typically produce a complex mixture of feelings. The book identifies some of the aesthetic possibilities afforded by expectation, and shows how common musical devices (such as syncopation, cadence, meter, tonality, and climax) exploit the psychological opportunities. The theory also provides new insights into the physiological psychology of awe, laughter, and spine-tingling chills. Huron traces the psychology of expectations from the patterns of the physical/cultural world through imperfectly learned heuristics used to predict that world to the phenomenal qualia we experienced as we apprehend the world.Bradford Books imprint},

    abstract = {Individuals choose varying music listening strategies to fulfill particular mood-regulation goals. However, ineffective musical choices and a lack of cognizance of the effects thereof can be detrimental to their well-being and may lead to adverse outcomes like anxiety or depression. In our study, we use the social media platform Reddit to perform a large-scale analysis to unearth the several music-mediated mood-regulation goals that individuals opt for in the context of depression. A mixed-methods approach involving natural language processing techniques followed by qualitative analysis was performed on all music-related posts to identify the various music-listening strategies and group them into healthy and unhealthy associations. Analysis of the music content (acoustic features and lyrical themes) accompanying healthy and unhealthy associations showed significant differences. Individuals resorting to unhealthy strategies gravitate towards low-valence tracks. Moreover, lyrical themes associated with unhealthy strategies incorporated tracks with low optimism, high blame, and high self-reference. Our findings demonstrate that being mindful of the objectives of using music, the subsequent effects thereof, and aligning both for well-being outcomes is imperative for comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of music.},
